         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We deſire to be found innocent from this tranſgreſſion, and do preſent what we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as for you, and not againſt you; having had it in our hearts to deſign, if poſſible, ſome communication of light, however ſome provocation of Love: whilſt you ſee our help, from the (ſeeming at leaſt, but to us) real countenance of the Scripture, you may finde reaſon to beleeve, we are nes preſumptuouſly wilful, though extremely weak.</p>
            <p>We may not conceal two things as heavy weights upon our ſpirits, when the Lord was calling us out to miniſter unto him in the publication of this work; which though we have been inabled to caſt from us, yet we are jealous leſt they may lie as ſtones of ſtumbling in your way, and obtain ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation to paſs upon us as criminals, before you have heard us plead our cauſe.</p>

            <p>And becauſe the many controverſies concerning Officers iſſue from a diverſe apprehenſion of the nature of the Church it ſelf, we ſhall crave leave in a few
<pb facs="tcp:120096:3"/>
words to give an account of our perſwaſion thereabout, with the grounds and reaſons thereof.</p>
            <p>It is unto us clear as the ſhining light, That a Church formed unto fellowſhip in New-Teſtament-Ordinances (we would not found a controverſie upon a word) a Church ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Officers, immediately to be ſet in it, and over it, who may <hi>take heed to all the flock, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſee and feed it,</hi> which alſo <hi>muſt know</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act 20. 28. 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. Heb. 13. 7, 17.</note> 
               <hi>them, obey and ſubmit unto them, as to ſuch as watch for their ſouls;</hi> is a particular company of Saints in mutual union for mutual fellowſhip in the means of worſhip appointed by Chriſt, for the glory of God, the edification of their own ſouls, and the good of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's a company; one cannot be a Church. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> is not, Tell the Biſhop; though ſome have had it, and ſtill would have it ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's a particular company: indeed there never was, never will be a company exiſting <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> any other then a particular company: we grant an Univerſal company of Saints in a reformed ſenſe, comprehending ever indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Saint-member thereof, whether formed unto fellowſhip, or unformed; but as Saints, not as Churches of Saints: as the world is univerſal, of which all Creatures are a part, yet did a man ſtand where he might ſee all Countreys and all Creatures, he ſhould ſee but a particular world, really par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but intellectually Univerſal: ſo when all Saints ſhall be gathered together at the right hand of the Lord, ther ſhall be ſeen a particular company of Saints, really particular, though intellectually univerſal; this being apprehended, <hi>viz.</hi> here are all, there are no more: it's otherwiſe with Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Saints formed into fellowſhip; did a manſtand where he might ſee all Corporations; all particular civil Societies of men, he might acknowledge the general nature of Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions exiſting in either of them, and yet deny an univerſal Corporation conſiſting of them as parts thereof: So were all
<pb facs="tcp:120096:4"/>
the particular Churches repreſented to his view at once, he might grant that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <note place="margin">Univerſalis natura eſt una in multis.</note> nature of a Church, is in either of them, yet deny an univerſal Church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them as parts thereof.</p>
            <p>Neither can we underſtand how that Scripture, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 28.</hi> ſo often preſſed into the ſervice of the Catholick Church, can be found really a friend thereunto: <hi>for God hath ſet ſome in the Church,</hi> is equivalent to that which is written, <hi>ver. 18. God hath ſet the members every one in [the] Body;</hi> now if this hath no ſtrength, <hi>God hath ſet the members in the Body, Ergo,</hi> There is a Catholick, Body; then this is weak: <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, Ergo,</hi> There is a Catholick Church. And let not our Brethren impute it to a ſpirit of faction and diviſion in us, that we renounce the name and thing of a Church, of Churches, or of ſuch a viſible Catholick Church: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every part is incompleat, not having the power of a whole in it: but every particular Church rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hath in it the power of a whole Church, therefore 'tis not a part: &amp; whatever our Brethren deny us in our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet may they obtain a conceſſion for a National Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitution, we doubt not but they would be therein Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and not allow the Authority of any Nation, or of all the Nations in the Chriſtian world, to impoſe a form of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Government upon them, wherein they are not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; acting in all Church-work, not as a part, but a whole: which they could not regularly doe, if but a part of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Let not any ſtumble at the corruption found in ſome of the Goſpel-Churches: an inceſtuous perſon was a member in that of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and more diſorder may be found in it: to which we ſay, filthy matter may be found in a Church rightly conſtituted, which is not fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the conſtitution thereof. It were abſurd to affirm,
<pb facs="tcp:120096:6"/>
an unclean perſon may <hi>de jure</hi> be a Church-member, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Church-member <hi>de facto</hi> was unclean. As for the National body of the Jewes, we reſpect it as a typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal preſident: <hi>purge out the leaven, remove the leper, him that hath an iſſue, that is unclean by touching of the dead, &amp;c.</hi> and we are ſatisfied concerning the matter of the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It's an united Company. A Company however qualified, are not a Church, except an united Company: Member-hood ſpeaks relation: relation, if Political, is founded in conſent: my brother indeed is my brother whether I will or no, this relation is natural; ſo beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are brethren without conſent: but my companion not ſo, the mutual relation found in Companies and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men, is not ſo. We would not quarrel about a word, expreſſing the meaning of union; may we obtain a grant of the thing it ſelf, call it conſent. agreement, covenant, or joyning, <hi>Act. 5. 13.</hi> Thus we argue, That whereby a number of fit perſons are joyned together, to walk and worſhip God together in the ſame Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is the form of a particular Church. But by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, conſent, or agreement, a number of fit perſons are ſo joyned: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> we prove thus: That which giveth being of Member-hood, diſtinction of Churches, and power of Eccleſiaſtical operation, is that, by which a number of fit perſons are joyned together, &amp;c. But Covenant, conſent, or agreement, giveth being of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-hood in a particular Church, diſtinction of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and power of operation: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The being of Member-hood is conveyed in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: not in profeſſion or baptiſm, <hi>Ergo,</hi> in Covenant: the excommunicate <hi>Corinthian</hi> was a viſible beleever, and alſo under baptiſm, before he was received into the Church again by conſent; yet till then, he was no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The diſtinction of every member, and ſo of the
<pb facs="tcp:120096:7"/>
whole Church, from other members and other Churches is by Covenant. The members of <hi>Smyrna</hi> are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> nor <hi>è contra:</hi> the diſtinction is not in place: <hi>Phebe</hi> is a member and ſervant of the Church at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> when ſhe is at <hi>Rome.</hi> Did the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> convene at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and do an act there, it were the act of the Church of <hi>Smyrne,</hi> aſmuch as if it had been done in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where ordinarily they meet and walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: nor is the deſtinction from profeſſion: what is common to the Members of every Church cannot be the form of any Church; but the deſtenction is from mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ingagement. The power of acting as Members one towards another is hereby; when a way is ſolitary, work ſolitary, a man may walk alone work alone; not ſo where ſocial: how can two walk together except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed? The Aſſociated Paſtors and Churches in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi> upon their debate about conſent, conclude: <hi>We have reaſon to require, as things now ſtand, a more expreſs ſignification of our peoples conſent to our Miniſtery, and Miniſterial actions, and their Memberſhip of our particular Churches: Chriſtian Concore,</hi> pag <hi>11.</hi> Which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſtrengthned with many reaſons, wherein they urge <hi>Antiquity,</hi> Reaſon <hi>11. Conveniency,</hi> Reaſon <hi>12.</hi> and ſpeaking of the Primitive Churches to that Queſtion, <hi>Whether expreſs conſent were required then,</hi> among other things they (or <hi>M.

                  </gap>xter</hi> for them) affirm, <hi>that without the peoples expreſs conſent none could then have ruled them by meet Eccleſiaſtical rule.</hi> pag. <hi>15.</hi> Who have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the form of a covenant drawn up and added to the profeſſion of faith to be taken by the Members of every particular Church reſpectively.</p>
            <p>And the late Aſſembly in their anſwer to the reaſons of the diſſenting Brethren, againſt the inſtance of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> attribute ſo much to conſent in a Church organical that although they ſay Elders receive their power and commiſſion for the whole Church of
<pb facs="tcp:120096:7"/>
Chriſt. yet they may not exerciſe that without a Call; and the mutual aſſent and agreement of the perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom and to whom they ſhould exerciſe it is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximum fundamentum exercitii,</hi> pag. <hi>10.</hi> So it is of every act of ſpecial duty, by one man in reference to another, according to <hi>Mat. 18. 15.</hi> that ſhould a man proceed upon that rule in dealing with one not in ſpecial covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, he would ſoon ſee his error, and that he had no call, becauſe no conſent.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren need not be ſo much offended, that we make conſent the form of a congregational Church, when themſelves, as it ſeemeth unto us, make it the form of a Presbyterial: For granting that the Elders of a borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Presbytery (though Neighbors) may not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the congregations under, another Presbytery, they ſay, <hi>They take themſelves bound in a ſpecial relation to thoſe Congregations, who are aſſociated in that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, in thoſe things for which they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcciated; and their mutual conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aſſemblies Anſwer.</note> 
               <hi>gives them that relation and calling to thoſe things.</hi> pag. 11.</p>
            <p>Moreover, conſidering how far our Brethren are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this matter, we much wonder at their offence at our Covenant or Agreement: for they will grant,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the members of particular Churches are under ſpecial engagement, to ſpecial duty in taking the care of, and in watching ever one another; ſo that the Church neglecting duty herein is guilty of the ſin of every member, as the Church of Corinth of the ſin of the inceſtuons perſons, <hi>1 Cor. 5.</hi> and the ſeven Churches of Aſia of the ſin of their ſeveral members reſpectively: and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That members of a particular Church ought by the inſtitution of Chriſt to walk together in Ordinances; and that walking in Ordinances with another Church, and not with the ſame Church, is ſinful ſeparation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:120096:8"/>
3. The obligation upon a member to walk with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church cannot be diſſolved by the private will of that member, nor by the conſent of any other Church, but that of which he is a member; according to the known Rule, <hi>Ejuſdem eſt deſtituere cujus conſtituere:</hi> onely in this they are contrary unto us, That they judge the remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an habitation a diſanulling of former relation: but if cohabitation gives not member-hood. though that ceaſe, member-hood is not taken away; but co-habitation, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not member-hood, no, although joyned with profeſſion and baptiſm: the inceſtuous Corinth excommunicate had all theſe, but no member-hood, until by conſent received again into the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, we plead but the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under an acknowledged inſtitution, whereby members in their private perſonal capacites altogether free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come engaged to fellow members; which we apprehend to be by mutual Combination, Conſociation, Conſent or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and know not what rock of offence is herein for any to ſtumble at; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> believe, as white Wine, put into a blew-coloured Glaſs, is in appearance blew and not white; ſo the innocent Truth obſerved in a glaſs of Prejudice, appeareth prejudicial, and not Truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A company united unto fellowſhip in means of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, appointed by Jeſus Chriſt: all worſhip is either natural, <hi>i. e.</hi> founded in the nature of God, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the light of Nature, as Faith, Love, &amp;c. which are inviſible: and hearing what God doth ſpeak calling upon God, Singing praiſes unto God; which are viſible parts of worſhip: Or inſtituted, <hi>i. e.</hi> founded in the will of God, and knowable by the Scriptures, as Baptiſm by Water, breaking of Bread in the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No worſhip is founded in the will of man, but Will-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts whoſe Church is ſo full of power as to make Decrees of equal authority with the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:120096:8"/>
yet are modeſt in the reaſon of this power which they plead, becauſe ſay they, The Church hath the Spirit to guide her, and the Decrees thereof are from the ſame Spirit whence the ten Commands were; but we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied concerning Revelations, and ſhall expect none, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard none, in <hi>nova materia,</hi> in new matters to be revealed, yet ſhall plead them, and pray for them in <hi>novo actu,</hi> in new acts of diſcoverie of that which in Scripture is revealed; being perſwaded that hee which hath entred into his reſt hath ceaſed from his work, as God did from his; from his Prieſtly work, in bearing ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 10.</note> his Regal work in deſtroying Satan, Death, and the Grave; from his Prophetical work, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Laws and Ordinances, to his holy Church; the Sabbath-work of the Son (as the Fathers alſo) being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of work then that which was antecedent to his Sabbath.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall ſay no more of this, our Brethren being not baptized into a belief of the ſame truth, aſſerting Presbyterial Government to be from heaven, in the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Church-Government: although the confidence of our late Aſſembly could ſpeak no more but this: The Scripture doth hold forth, that many particular Congregations <note place="margin">The third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Aſſemb. preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> may be under one Pesbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: may be they would have ſaid. Muſt be, had they ſeen the ſtamp of <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The end of this fellowſhip is the glory of God. Edification of members, good of others; in this alſo we are agreed: and truly Brethren, we deſire to end in agreement; but we are jealous leſt the diſpleaſure of ſome may be provoked againſt us, not onely for our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for our p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

ſome Truths, which ſeemed to them to ſuffer wrong: therefore are they come into the Field; and whether they quit themſelves like men, the enſuing Diſcourſe will declare. It's of a Polemical Nature; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies are ſeldom managed without heat: in ſuch engagements men are apt to offend perſons, whilſt they defend Truth; and proceed too far upon the account of their own intereſt; minding not ſo much what's to be ſaid for Truth oppoſed, as what's to be laid upon the Oppoſers. Theſe Brethren, and Friends to Truth, have no ſuch Spirit in them: they contend for the Truth, yet are not contentious; like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Michael,</hi> they are milde and meek, having nothing provocative in their Lips or Pens: their Moderation will appear to all men: more love, ſweetneſs and candor, in a work of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can hardly be found or expected.</p>
            <p>Reader, wouldſt thou know whether men unordained may warrantably preach; whether Election or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do give the Eſſentials to a Miniſter or Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer; whether ſuch an Officer relate to the Church univerſal, or to a particular Church, which are things of great concernment: conſult this Tractate, read it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, weigh things ſeriouſly, and doubtleſs thou wilt finde much ſatisfaction, and ſee cauſe to bleſs the Lord for the labours of theſe his Servants.

                  <p>Wherein is ſhewn, that Office is not a Relation to the work or employment of the Miniſtery, but a Relation to a Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the many Books lately publiſhed againſt the preaching of Gifted men, and for Ordiantion as that which gives the Call unto that work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, there are two, which (we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) have the ſtrength of all the reſt in them; the title of the one is, <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſterii Enangelici</hi> or, The Divine Right of the Goſpel-Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: publiſhed by the Provincial Aſſembly of London. The title of the other is, <hi>Vindiciae Miniſterii Enan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici;</hi> by <hi>Mr. Collings</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe we finde ſome poſitions which we can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſcribe unto; but there are other aſſertions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we profeſs our diſſent. And though we intend not to reply to every particular, yet we ſhall give ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions upon the moſt conſiderable things, as will leave it unneceſſary to ſpeak to the reſt.</p>
               <p>We freely acknowledge, That Officers are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Churches of Chriſt by Divine Inſtitution;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:120096:14"/>
and alſo, that they are to continue untill the ſecond coming of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore we ſhall not put in exceptions againſt the Arguments brought by our Brethren in their <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> for the proof of theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Only we ſhall except againſt part of their explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their firſt Propoſition.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is, <q>That the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word and Sacraments is neceſſary in the Church by Divine Inſtitution.</q> For the underſtanding of this, they undertake to ſhew,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What is meant by Miniſtery.</item>
                  <item>2. What by Office.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant by Miniſtery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Miniſtery (as our Brethren well obſerve) ſtandeth in oppoſition to Lordly Domination or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. v. 25, 26, 27. <hi>The Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Dominion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe Authority upon them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter; and whoſoever will be chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him be your ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miniſtery is not Dominion, but ſervice. Officers in a ſpeciall ſence are called Miniſters, yet (we conceive) that others may properly be called Miniſters alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſervice they do for Chriſt. Both the words in the Original which our Brethren here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to expreſs the Office of the Miniſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are frequently in Scripture applyed to Saints that are no officers; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſtring to the Saints.</hi> Act. 24. 23. <hi>Forbid none of his acquaintance</hi> [to Miniſter] <hi>or come unto him.</hi> In theſe and other places, Chriſtians who are no officers are ſaid to Miniſter, in giving Alms, &amp;c. and therefore let none thinke that the name Miniſter is appropriated only to officers. It is the office of Deacons to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:120096:14"/>
about carnal things, and yet other Chriſtians doe Miniſter about ſuch things alſo; as the forecited Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhew. So Officers, Paſtors or Teachers doe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Goſpel, and yet gifted men may be ſaid to Miniſter in the Goſpel alſo: for there is miniſtration or ſervice in their preaching; and therefore gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whoſe ordinary work or calling it is to Preach, may properly be called Miniſters of the Goſpel, as well as thoſe who are officers; for ordinary Miniſtration denominates the perſon a Miniſter. Occaſional acts of preaching may be called Miniſtring, and the perſons therein do Miniſter in the Goſpel; but becauſe they do not addict and give up themſelves to that as their work, hence they cannot properly be called Miniſters of the Goſpel: for ſuch a denomination followeth an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and nor an occaſional acting in any work.</p>
               <p>A general courſe of acting is neceſſary to the making a general title proper to any perſon. As a man is not deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated a Brewer or a Baker, that doth but occaſionally brew or bake; but he that doth it ordinarily or conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and maketh it his work to do it. So here. This we have added the rather, becauſe ſome call gifted men Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their preaching, ſpeaking, and that to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them and their actings from officers and their acts: they are afraid to call gifted men preachers or Miniſters; or their actings preaching or Miniſtring.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is meant by the word Office?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Brethren give us a deſcription of Office, and it is this: <q>The Office of the Miniſtery, is a ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the whole employment of the Miniſtry in a perſon qualified, founded upon a ſpecial and regular call.</q> This deſcription we apprehend to be very faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and becauſe a right underſtanding of this, What Office is, doth much conduce to the clearing this whole controverſie, we ſhall declare wherein we do diſſent in this matter, and upon what grounds.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Office is a Relation which reſpects employment as its end, we grant: that it is a Relation to the employment, or whole employment of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as its correlate, we deny. Unto all Relations, there is a Relate and a Correlate abſolutely neceſſary, ſo as no Relation can have a being without theſe two.

               <p n="1">1. The Relate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Officer, as is undenya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Correlate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church. Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in their definition of Office, ſeem to make [the whole employment of the Miniſtry] the Correlate; and in the ſame page they aſſert, That Office is better defined by Relation to the work, then by relation to a particular people, who may eaſily out him of his work, but (they ſay) not of his Office.</p>
               <p>Afterward in their <hi>Jus Divinum (pag.</hi> 151.) ſay they, <q>That every Miniſter hath a double Relation, one to the particular Church of which he is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; the other to the Church Univerſal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In their definition they would have [the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Miniſtry] the Correlate; and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where they grant a Church to be the Correlate, both a particular and the Univerſal. So that there will ariſe two queſtions.</p>

The Relation is deſtroyed or denyed, if both be not in being. It is no Relate, unleſs there be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that it is related to: Now our Brethren grant, <hi>page</hi> 2. [the work] of the Miniſtry is ſeparable from the Office, by ſickneſs, impriſonment, baniſhment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the people. And they ſay, <hi>page</hi> 3. <q>That the people may eaſily out him of his work, &amp;c.</q> By all which it is evident, that according to the own principles, Office doth continue and remain, when the work and imployment of the Miniſtry doth ceaſe, and is at an end: And thence we infer, that it is impoſſible, that Office ſhould be a Relation to the imployment of the Miniſtry; for Office muſt ceaſe, as often as the work or imployment of the Miniſtry ceaſeth; if imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the Correlate: for <hi>Relatorum uno ſublato, tolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; alterum;</hi> Take away one of the Relatives, and the other is taken away alſo. Take away the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſtry, and Office muſt ceaſe, if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and Office be Relatives. As well you may affirm a man to be a father who hath no childe, or a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who hath no ſervant, or a husband, who hath no wife; as you may affirm a man to be an officer, who hath no imployment, if Office and imployment be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives.</p>

So that inſtead of avoyding that ſuppoſed inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of a mans being outed of his Office, by a peoples outing him of his work, they doe unavoydably bring themſelves into it, by aſſerting Office to be a Relation unto the imployment of the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. From the neceſſity of a praeexiſtence of the means unto the end, of the cauſe unto the effect; the means muſt have a being in order, before the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the end; the cauſe muſt have exiſtence, before the production of the effect. The Relation muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent unto that action which is peculiar to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Now (according to our Brethrens principles) the imployment of the Miniſtery, is the end of Office. <hi>page</hi> 39. They interpret <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. of the ends for which thoſe gifts were given, which are mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles and ſome Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> and the work of the Miniſtry is mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and ſo that is one end of thoſe Offices. Yea, our Brethren ſay, <hi>(Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 81.) <q>God hath deſigned ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Officers of his own for the preaching of the word; therefore none ought, or may preach the word, but ſuch as are deſigned unto this Office.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They make Preaching an act peculiar to Office, &amp; ſay, a man muſt be an Officer, before he may do the work, and ſo (according to their principles) there muſt be the Relation (which cannot be without a Correlate) before the imployment of the Miniſtry; and therefore the imployment cannot be the Correlate, becauſe that cometh after the Relation is compleated. This muſt be an argument to them, whether it be ſutable to our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or not. And thus far we aſſert it, That men muſt be Officers, Paſtors or Teachers, before the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſtry, Office-wiſe; and therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there muſt be a Correlate in being, before that which is the work of the relation is performed, and therefore work cannot be the Correlate. We ſay [Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-wiſe]
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120096:16"/>
for we ſhall ſhew afterward, that ſome part of the ſame work which Officers perform, may be done by ſuch as are no Officers; the matter is alike, but the manner is different.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. From the Goſpels owning a Church as the Correlate. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>The Elders of the Church.</hi> Here the Holy-Ghoſt declareth, that Church and Elder are the Relatives: and <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God.</hi> The Flock, the Church of God, and Elders, or Overſeers, are declared to be thoſe between whom the Relation is. Officers are related to Churches, not to the imployment of the Miniſtry. The Relation layeth obligations upon Officers to doe the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but the Relation muſt be before imployment Office-wiſe, and is between Officers and Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. From the Titles given in Scripture to Officers: It is obſerved by Logicians, that <hi>Relatorum uno cognito, cognoſcitur alterum.</hi> Of Relations, if one be known, the other is known alſo. We call no man a father or maſter, unleſs we know he hath a childe or a ſervant. The very names of Relatives doe decalre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom the Relation is. The name of a father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth a child to be the other Relative, <hi>&amp; è contra;</hi> the name of a ſon doth imply a father to be the other Relative: and ſo for other Relations.</p>
               <p>Now the names and titles which the Goſpel giveth unto Officers, have ſuch reference unto a Church, as they do aloud proclaim that Officer and Church are the Relatives, and not Officer and imployment. If the queſtion be asked, <hi>To whom are they Officers?</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer muſt be, To a Church. Officers are called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and that intimateth, that they are related to ſome flocks. They are called Teachers, and that ſpeaketh them to be related to ſome who are Learners. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120096:17"/>
we conclude, that Office is not a Relation to the imployment of the Miniſtry, but to a Church; one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial end of which Relation is, the work of the Miniſtry therein.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We affirm, That Officers ſtand in relation (as Officers) to a particular Church onely: and we deny that they are Officers to a Church Univerſal. Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at laſt grant a Relation between Officers and a particular Church, <hi>page</hi> 143. and 151. and it's proved from <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. We ſhall here hint a few words, chiefly to ſhew, that they are not Officers to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church; and then it will neceſſarily follow, that the Relation is between the Officer and a particular Church only. We deny Paſtors or Teachers to be Officers to an Univerſal Church.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Becauſe we can finde no Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrant, for any Univerſal-viſible-Political-Church. The Goſpel knoweth no ſuch Catholick or Univerſal Church, that we can any where finde.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Titles given unto Officers, doe ſpeak their office to be limited unto a particular Church, and do forbid or deny their bearing any office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation to a Church Univerſal. In thoſe Scriptures where (our Brethren ſay) there is an enumeration of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:120096:17"/>
Officers, and ſo where it is moſt needful that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt Names and Titles ſhould be given them; yet there thoſe Officers which are ſtill continuing, are called Paſtors and Teachers. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets thirdly [Teachers.]</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangelists and ſome [Paſtors and Teachers.]</hi> And alſo where the qualifications of ſuch Officers are layd down, and ſo the propereſt Titles are neceſſary, that it might ever be known, what Officer ought to be ſo qualified; there they are called [Biſhops] which is no more but [O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers] as <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock. over which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Biſhops</hi> or, <hi>Overſeers.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1, 2. <hi>[A Biſhop] muſt be blameleſs, the husband of one wife, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, ſober.</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7. For <hi>[a Biſhop] muſt be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Titles being given upon ſuch ſpecial occaſions unto Officers, they muſt undenyably be ſuch Names and Titles as are proper to them ſo long as they are Officers. It were an impeachment to the wiſdome of the Holy-Spirit, to ſay, that then it did impoſe ſuch names upon them, as they might loſe before they loſt their Office. We ſuppoſe our Brethren will not ſay, that any are Preaching-Officers, who are neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Teachers, nor Biſhops, or Overſeers.</p>
               <p>Now we argue thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Major Propoſit.</hi> That Church only that is a mans flock, doth or can he bear the Relation or Office of a Paſtor to. That Church only that is committed to ones charge for teaching, doth or can he bear the Relation or Office of a teacher to. That Church only that is committed to a mans overſight, doth or can he bear the Relation or Office of a Biſhop or Overſeer to. All this appeareth from thoſe Relative names. You may as well ſay, a man is a father to that which is none of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:120096:18"/>
childe, or a maſter to him who is none of his ſervant, as you may ſay, a man is a Paſtor to any that are not of his flock, or a Teacher to thoſe that are not committed to him to be taught, or a Biſhop and Overſeer to thoſe that are not under his overſight. So that if a man cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to have a flock, then he muſt needs ceaſe to be a Paſtor: if he ceaſeth to have a Church to be taught by him, then he ceaſeth to be a reacher by office: if he ceaſeth to have any to be overſeen by him, then he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be a Biſhop or Overſeer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minor propoſ.</hi> But only a particular Church is a mans flock, or is committed to a man for teaching and overſight, and not the Univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl. Ergo,</hi> A man beareth the relation or office of a Paſtor, a Teacher, or a Biſhop or Overſeer, only to a particular, and not to an Univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>That only a particular Church is a mans flock, or is committed to a man for teaching and overſight, and not the Univerſal Church; We ſuppoſe our Brethren can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny: for in their <hi>Jus Divinum, page</hi> 143. they have theſe words. <q>Though we beleeve that every Miniſter is a Miniſter of the Univerſal Church, yet we are far from thinking, that he is actually an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Miniſter. The Apoſtles had the actual care of the Church Univerſal committed unto them, and they were not fixed to any particular charge, but were Miniſters alike of all the Churches of Chriſt. But it is far otherwiſe with ordinary Miniſters, they are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their particular congregations, where they are bound by Divine right to reſide, &amp;c.</q> So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgment of our Brethren, ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſuch as Paſtors and Teachers are, have onely the care of particular Churches committed to them; their actual power is limited by Divine right to theſe, and not extended to the Univerſal Church: they have no actual power to perform Miniſterial offices, or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:120096:18"/>
the Ordinances of Chriſt in any Churches without a ſpecial call, but only in thoſe particular Churches, where they are fixed.</p>
               <p>And that it is only a particular Church, that is a mans flock, or is committed to him, for teaching and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and not the Univerſal Church, we prove thus:</p>
               <p>Becauſe every Paſtor, Teacher, or Overſeer, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded by Chriſt, actually to feed, teach, and overſee [all] the flock that is committed to him or them. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves and to</hi> (not only ſome, but) <hi>all the flock over the which the Holy-Spirit hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God.</hi> All that flock or Church, over which the Holy-Spirit hath made any man a Biſhop or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, he is commanded actually to feed and take heed to all the Univerſal Church, ſo as he ſinneth if he doth not. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Univerſal Church is not that flock or Church, over which the Holy-Spirit hath made any man a Biſhop or Overſeer. If they were to feed and take care of all the Univerſal Church, then their power were as extenſive and large as the Apoſtles; and then they muſt not fix and abide with any particular Church, for that would hinder the feeding all the Univerſal Church; but they muſt travel all the world over, that they may feed all the flock. And it's impoſſible that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Officer ſhould feed his particular Church, and all the reſt of the Univerſal Church alſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all were under a neceſſity of ſinning againſt this command, if that were the flock intended.</p>
               <p>The ſame Argument holdeth as well for Paſtors and Teachers, for they are the ſame Officers under different names. The Paſtors work is to feed all the flock, and he is plainly intended in that Text. And all that Church which is committed to any man for Teaching, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:120096:19"/>
to Teach, and he is unfaithful in his truſt, if he doth it not. And ſeeing it cannot be the Univerſal Church, hence undenyably, its only a particular Church that is a mans flock, or that is committed to him for Teaching and overſight.</p>
               <p>The Argument may run thus: That Church onely that a man is a Paſtor, or Teacher, a Biſhop or Overſeer to, doth he ſtand in the relation of an officer to: the Names and Titles of Officers do evidence this.</p>
               <p>But it is only a particular Church that a man is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor or Teacher, a Biſhop or Overſeer to. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and not an Univerſal Church:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is only a particular Church that a man doth ſtand in the relation of an officer to, und not an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If any ſhould object and ſay, If a man for a time be deſtitute of a place, or be fixed to no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, yet preacheth conſtantly in one place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may not that name of office [a Teacher] be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applyed to him, ſeeing he doth reach, and ſome are taught by him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In a general ſenſe he may be called a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if any be taught by him; but if the word Teacher be taken in a ſpecial ſenſe, to expreſs Office, in that ſenſe we deny he may be called a Teacher. Men are not Teachers by Office, to all that are taught by them. As for example, Our Brethren often urge it, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry teachers by office muſt be [ſent] <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be [ſont?]</hi> &amp; the word for ſent, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. and therefore in a general ſenſe they muſt ſay, that ordinary Officers, as Paſtors and Teachers, are [Apoſtles] becauſe Apoſtle ſignifieth one ſent. Yet Paſtors and Teachers are not Apoſtles by office; the Office of the Apoſtles, is diſtinct from the office of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers; and in this ſpecial ſenſe the name of Apoſtles is to be denyed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:120096:19"/>
So they are not Teachers by Office to all that they may preach to, and may be taught by them. If a man preacheth to Heathens and Indians, though they retain heatheniſh principles ſtill, and will not receive inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet in reſpect of his teaching, they are ſaid to be taught; and ſuch as ſtumble at the word are ſaid to be taught, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 54. <hi>He</hi> (i. e. Jeſus) <hi>taught them:</hi> and yet <hi>ver.</hi> 57. <hi>They were offended in him.</hi> But a man is not a teacher by office unto ſuch Hearhens, Indians, and oppoſers: for without ſome knowledge or profeſſion of Chriſt, our Brethren will not account them members of the Univerſal Church; and if they will ſay they ſtand in the relation of officers to ſuch, then they muſt aſſert that they have a treble relation as officers; one to a particular Church, another to an Univerſal Church, and a third to the World, or to Heathens and Indians, who are of no Church of Chriſt; or elſe they muſt ſay, that they preach as officers to thoſe they are no officers to: and it will hardly be proved, that they are officers to the world, or to any out of the Church.</p>
               <p>2. Onely that Church which a man is ſet over, hath taken the charge of, is committed to him for teaching, is he a teacher by office unto: if he preacheth in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, and thouſands receive inſtruction, and in that ſenſe are taught by him, yet we deny that he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in relation to any of theſe as a teacher by office, unleſs as a Church they be committed to him for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>For it is [ſetting over, taking the charge of, and the committing a Church to the care of ſuch a perſon, for ſuch and ſuch ends] which giveth being to office, or maketh one an officer. It's the committing of a flock to ſuch a perſon for feeding, or his taking charge of it, that onely maketh him a [Paſtor.] It is the ſetting one over a flock, or Church for overſight, that onely maketh him [a Biſhop or Overſeer:] and hence <hi>Act.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:120096:20"/>
20. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>The flock [over which] the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers.</hi> They are limited in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight unto the particular flock, and the nature of their of their office is expreſſed, by their being over the flock for that end.</p>
               <p>For this, ſee more in our deſcription of office, in the formal cauſe of it; and in our Arguments to prove that election giveth the Eſſence to the call to Office.</p>

               <p>Office, is a ſpiritual Relation between a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of Chriſt, and a perſon right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">what Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is.</note> qualified, founded upon a ſpecial and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular call.</p>
               <p>Or more particularly.</p>
               <p>Office, is a ſpiritual Relation, ariſing upon a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Election on the Churches part, and Acceptation on his part who is Elected, by which the Lord committeth a particular Church to his charge, or ſetteth him over it, for the work of the Goſpel, or imployment of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>In theſe Deſcriptions there is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general Nature of Office: It is a Relation; and for its property, it is a ſpiritual Relation, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from natural and civil Relations. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative names by which the Goſpel expreſſeth office, as Paſtor and Teacher, doe prove it to be a Relation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:120096:20"/>
2. The terms of the Relation, the Relate and the Correlate. The Relate is a perſon rightly qualified, <hi>i. e.</hi> qualified according to Goſpel rules. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>A Biſhop muſt blameleſs, the husband of one wife, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour, given to hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity, apt to teach, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. The Correlate is a particular Church of Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>The Elders of the Church.</hi> Act. 14. 23. Rev. 2. 1. <hi>Unto the Angel [of the Church.]</hi> And ver. 8, 12, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 7, 14. They are Officers to the Churches of Chriſt, not to the world, nor to civil Societies or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; and to particular Churches, as the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing each from other ſheweth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The efficient cauſes. The principal efficient cauſe is the Lord, he inſtituted and appointed officers to be in the Churches: It is the Lord that giveth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications ſutable to office. It is the Lord that giveth in his word rules and directions to be obſerved in the conſtitution of officers. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 6. And when there is a due obſervation of thoſe Divine rules, then the Lord maketh the officer. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. The inſtrumental cauſes are [the flock or Church, and the perſon qualified:] It is by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, that the relation is introduced. The Lord maketh uſe of them in the making officers, or the Lord doth make officers by ſome acts put forth by theſe. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The formal cauſe of office, [a ſpecial and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar call; or, the Lords committing of a flock, or Church of Chriſt to a mans charge, and ſetting him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by election on the Churches part, and acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his part who is elected.] We term it [a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial call] to difference it from the call which officers may have to lay out their gifts occaſionally amongſt thoſe that are no Church, or they no officers to; and to diſtinguiſh it from the call that gifted Brethren may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120096:21"/>
have to preach; which cals are common, we term it [a regular call] becauſe it is to be made according to Goſpel-rules.</p>
               <p>The external or outward call (which is to be ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) conſiſteth in election with acceptation. A Church is to chuſe its officers. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>They choſe Stephen.</hi> An inferior officer, a Deacon, muſt be choſen; much more is a free choyce neceſſary to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er officer, who is to take care of Souls. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>In every Church they choſe them Elders.</hi> Let any prove that the Goſpel alloweth any man to take the charge of a Church by compulſion, or whether the people will or no. And a Church cannot compel or force a man to be over it, or to be a Paſtor to it, without his free conſent; and therefore acceptation on his part is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the introduction of the Relation. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>If a man [deſire] the Office of a Biſhop.</hi> An inclination or diſpoſition to the office, is to accompany an entrance upon it. The doing the work of office would be by conſtraint, and not willingly; contrary to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. if the undertaking that work were not with free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. By election the Church offereth to commit it ſelf unto his charge who is elected: By his acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he actually taketh the charge of that Church. I Goſpel-rules be obſerved in both, then the Lord doth ſet him over it. The Lords committing of a flock or Church to a mans charge, or ſetting him over it for the work of the Miniſtry, is the formal cauſe of office, or that which giveth being to it: this is the ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſtinguiſhing thing of an officer from no officer. For duty is commanded from a man upon ſuch a ſetting over a flock, as from an officer, he is to feed and take heed to all the flock or Church that he is over. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Take heed—to all the flock over the which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, &amp;c.</hi> And that Church is commanded duty towards
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120096:21"/>
him that is over it, as towards an officer. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13 <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give account, &amp;c.</hi> That which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a mans charge, he is not to give an account for; and therefore it is here intimated, that he which is over a flock, hath the charge of it committed to him; the flock ought to obey and ſubmit to him as an officer: which could not be, if ſetting over or giving the charge of a flock, did not give being to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or office. That the ſetting over is by Election with acceptation, we ſhall afterwards demonſtrate more fully.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The final cauſe, or the end of office, [the work of the Goſpel, or imployment of the Miniſtry] <hi>i. e.</hi> in that Church he is ſet over, for he doth not act as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to any other. The Apoſtle giveth this as the end of office-gifts, <hi>Epheſ. 4. ver. 11. He gave ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers;</hi> for what end? <hi>ver. 12. For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for the ediſying of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> And thus we have ſhewn what office is.</p>
               <p>From what hath been already cleared, we might draw many concluſions; take two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. Hence it followeth, That there is no difference between that which maketh a man [a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, a Paſtor, a Shepheard] and that which makes a man [their Miniſter, their Paſtor, their Shepherd;] and ſo that diſtinction ſo often repeated by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſo often called in for their relief, will lend them no help at all, being a diſtinction without a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For we have proved, that a man is an officer to a particular Church only, and therefore that which maketh him an officer, a Paſtor, maketh him their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, their Paſtor, as the ſame that maketh a man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120096:22"/>
an husband, or a woman a wife, doth make him her husband, and make her his wife. We would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretch the ſimilitude, to ſay that the Relation between an officer and a Church, doth in all things agree to that between man and wife; but in this it may agree, and doth illuſtrate very fitly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2. Hence it followeth undenyably, That the diſtinction between preaching and office, and <hi>ex do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> by office and by gift, is Scriptural, or founded on Scripture: for if a man be a Paſtor or officer only to a particular Church, then if he preacheth to any other Church but that he is an officer to, or to any other perſons but of that Church, he preacheth to them but <hi>ex dono,</hi> by gift, not as an officer to them. Now our Brethren cannot deny the lawfulneſs of preaching to thoſe that are not of a mans particular Church; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a ſpecial means for the converſion of Heathens, and Indians, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 24. If <hi>all Propheſie, and there come in one that beleeveth not.</hi>—So that unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſuch as are no Church-Members may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come into Church-meetings, to hear the Goſpel preached. And it is lawful in ſome caſes, to go and Preach to unbeleevers, when they do not come to Church-meetings. <hi>Act</hi> 16. 13, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21. Yet they are no officers to ſuch unbeleevers, they have not the charge of ſuch unbeleevers ſouls committed to them, they are not over them in the Lord; they cannot as officers exerciſe Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment towards unbeleevers, that are no Church-Members: they are not their flock, for then they might do it: and therefore in preaching to Heathens, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,—they do not act as officers, but meerly as in the capacity of gifted brethren; and this leadeth us unto that great queſtion, about the preaching of gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Queſtion is ſtated about the Preaching of Gifted-men, and ſeveral things propounded for the clearing the ſtate of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The Queſtion is this,</p>
               <p>WHether ſome men who are not ordained <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Officers may preach? Or, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have preaching gifts and graces, or are apt to teach, may ordinarily exerciſe thoſe gifts in Publick Aſſemblies, though they be not ordained Officers?</p>
               <p>Before we come to the determination of this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall premiſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the queſtion is not, Whether every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may publickly preach? But, whether ſome not in office, who have ſuch eminent gifts and graces, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them apt to teach, may not exerciſe thoſe gifts in a way of Preaching? That objection which our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren bring from 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 29. toucheth not us; for many Chriſtians have not ſuch gifts, and ſo all are not Prophets, all are not Teachers: Our inquiry is not, whether every beleever, but whether thoſe beleevers who have ſuch gifts and qualifications as the Goſpel (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3.) requireth preachers ſhould have, may preach?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is the queſtion, Whether Ordination be neceſſary for an officer. We grant that when a man undertaketh to be an officer to, or taketh the charge of a Church of Chriſt, there ought to be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, before the exerciſe of his Office. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
               <p>Our queſtion is, Whether a man who hath grace and ſuch gifts as render him apt to teach, may exerciſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:120096:23"/>
thoſe gifts ordinarily or frequently without Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he being no Officer to any Church of Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is the queſtion, Whether any man that thinketh himſelf gifted may preach? If ſome think themſelves gifted who are not, and thereupon preach, we plead not for them. But if a man be really gifted as the Lord requireth officers ſhould be, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. If really he be apt to teach, &amp;c. Our queſtion is, Whether he may not publickly do it, though he be not ordained?</p>
               <p>It is another queſtion, Who ſhall judge of his gifts? Yet if a man be judged able by thoſe who are able to judge, or by thoſe that are appointed by Chriſt to judg of his gifts, we apprehend he may preach. And the Apoſtles referred it to the Church to judge of their gifts and qualifications who were to be Deacons, <hi>Act. 6. ver. 3. Look yee out among you ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the Holy-Ghoſt and wiſdom.</hi> There is not a fillable about any other proving of them after; &amp; the Church was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to look out men ſo qualified; and therefore a Church of Chriſt is to judge of the gifts of its Members. Deacons are to be proved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and it is by the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. And though one that is really gifted for ſuch a work (for ought we know) may lawfully (eſpecially in ſome caſes) preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch approbation from a Church, or others who are able to judge of gifts; yet it may be inexpedient, and ſometimes it proveth of ill conſequence to others, and uncomfortable to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By preaching we underſtand, any publiſhing or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, opening or applying Goſpel truths to any perſons for the uſes and ends they ſerve to. Sometimes the word for preaching is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies to tell good news, or bring or publiſh glad tidings. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>The Kingdom of God [is preached,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Unto us was the Goſpel preached.</hi>—1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:120096:23"/>
9. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Though [I preach the Goſpel]</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And the ſame word is uſed for preaching in many other Scriptures, and denoteth a declaring or publiſhing Goſpel-truths; and hence it is ſo tranſlated often, and that neceſſarily. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you glad tidings.</hi> The word for [declare, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet [of them that preach the Goſpel]</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and bring glad tidings of good, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here the ſame word is uſed, and ſignifieth to bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. In the beginning of that verſe another word is uſed for preaching. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>How ſhall they preach,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and this word ſignifieth, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as Heralds or cryers do; it is explained twice in the latter end of the ſame <hi>verſe,</hi> why he is called a herald or cryer, becauſe he publiſheth or telleth glad tidings. So that to preach, is to declare or publiſh, to open or apply Goſpel-truths to any perſons, whether publickly or privately. Though a Herald or cryer doth deliver a matter in an open place, yet that Metaphor may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, becauſe preaching is by lively voyce, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in a publick place; yet it may be properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led preaching, though it be in private. <hi>Act. 5. ver 42. Daily in the Temple, and in every houſe they ceaſed not to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here is preaching not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publickly in the Temple, but alſo privately in every houſe. Yea, <hi>Philip</hi> is ſaid to preach to one man. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 35. So that it is preaching, if the Scriptures be opened or expounded to a particular perſon, as well as if it be to a publick Aſſembly. And therefore our Brethrens deſcription of preaching is faulty: They ſay, <hi>(Jus Divinum page</hi> 77.) <q>By preaching they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand an authoritative explication and application of Scripture, for exhortation, edification and comfort, to a Congregation met together for the ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, in the ſtead and place of Chriſt.</q> They
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120096:24"/>
ſay, The ſubject is the word, the work the explication and application of this word. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. The end is, the exhortation, edification and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Church; for which they alledge, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. The object, a Congregation met together for the ſolemn worſhip of God; for which they alledge, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. They ſay, The word is to be preached to infidels. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. But the principal object of this work is the Church. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 22. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. The manner of doing this work,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Authoritatively, not Magiſterially, as lords of faith; but Miniſterially, as being over the Church in the Lord. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the ſtead and place of Chriſt. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>From this deſcription, they give us five diſtinctions, wherein they grant us ſeveral things. We ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That place, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. will ſerve for us to prove a gift of propheſying to be ſtill continuing, as well as it wil ſerve to prove their deſcription of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If propheſying were an extraordinary gift, as they ſay <hi>(pag.</hi> 97. 98.) it was, why then doe they alledge it to prove the way of that ſtanding ordinance of preaching?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is properly preaching, to publiſh, declare, and open Goſpel-truths, though there be not a Church or congregation for the object of it; or though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation be not met for the ſolemn worſhip of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>Philip preached unto [him] Jeſus.</hi> Here is preaching, and yet no congregation, but only a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon for the object of it. So <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 42. And it is properly preaching, when Goſpel-truths are publiſhed, opened, and declared to a Congregation, though it be not met for the ſolemn worſhip of God, but for other, even contrary ends. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>We
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120096:24"/>
alſo are men of like paſſions with you, [and preach unto you] that ye ſhould turn from theſe vanities unto the living God. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are ſaid to preach unto thoſe that met for Idolatrous ends, not for the ſolemn worſhip of God. So <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 18, 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c. While Paul waited—at Athens, his ſpirit was ſtirred in him, when he ſaw the City wholly given to idolatry.</hi> &amp; v. 18. <hi>[He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] unto them Jeſus.</hi>—And his ſermon we have epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here was preaching, and yet it was to an idolatrous Aſſembly; ſo that if the work be performed (which our Brethren ſay, is the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application of the word) whoever be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, yet it is preaching; and therefore their <hi>third, fourth,</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> diſtinctions <hi>(Jus Divin. page 79.)</hi> will make againſt them. They grant that a General may give an exhortation in the head of an Army, and a Judg on a Bench, from the examples of <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. Of <hi>Abijah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. Of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 20. <hi>Joſhua, Chap.</hi> 23. 24. But they ſay, there is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this action and the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; for neither is the object of it a Congregation ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, but meerly civil; neither is the authority Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and from Chriſt, but meerly political. We have proved, that it is properly preaching, if the work be done for its proper end, though it be not a congregation that is the object of it, nor a congregation ſacred, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and idolatrous. A Church is a proper object of preaching, but not the peculiar or only object thereof: for by their own grant, Infidels are to be preached to, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. And ſuch a good end of meeting together, <hi>viz.</hi> ſolemnly to worſhip God, may help to render the action of the hearer good; but it doth not make the action of the Speaker, Preaching. As for a Judge on a Bench, it is but a political-civil action that he is about; and if he mentioneth ſome Scriptures, it is but to qualify a natural or civil action Chriſtianly; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120096:25"/>
this may hinder that from being preached, not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being a congregation meerly civil. But if a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of an Army or any other man doth take an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to open and apply Scriptures, or declare Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, not for a civil end chiefly, but for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and edification of thoſe he ſpeaketh to, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the mind and wil of Chriſt; and this not in an intermixed way, to qualify civil actions; how this can be denyed to be preaching, we know not: And therefore let our Brethren conſider, whether their own grant from thoſe Scriptures, will not ſpeak for the preaching of gifted men?</p>
               <p>The ſame we ſay to their fourth diſtinction; <hi>(Jus Divin. page</hi> 79.) they diſtinguiſh between Divinity-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes in the Schooles and Univerſity, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word: they ſay, theſe are not performed to a congregation met together for the ſolemn worſhip of God, they are rather reducible to the work of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters inſtructing their Scholars, and Scholars ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring account to their Maſters, then Miniſterial preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>We have proved that if ſuch a ſolemn action, as the declaring, opening and applying of Goſpel-truths be performed for its proper ends; it is preaching, though the congregation be met together for irreligious and wicked ends, and did not meet for the ſolemn worſhip of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore it muſt needs be preaching, when the object is, an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly met for lawful ends; and though the tryal of gifts, and the perſons rendring an account of their proficiency in ſuch ſtudies, may be ſubordinate ends of ſuch actions in the Univerſity, yet the edification of the hearers ought to be the main and principal end of Divinity-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctutes, or common placing. We know no Goſpel-rule for ſuch actions, without this as the chief end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By our Brethrens grant (we ſuppoſe) it will be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120096:25"/>
lawful for gifted men to preach charitatively. They diſtinguiſh <hi>(Jus Divin. page</hi> 78, 80.) between a private brotherly teaching, admonition, exhortation of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and an authoritative publick teaching. The firſt (they ſay) is grounded on charity, and is the common duty of all Chriſtians, by the royal Law of Love, and preſcribed to all, even to women, by the law of God, under pain of ſin.—Alſo they diſtinguiſh between the teaching of Parents and Maſters in their families, and Schoolmaſters, and Miniſterial Preaching; the former they exhort even Mothers unto; but the Miniſterial teaching they deny them. They alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the act of Members in any ſacred or civil Aſſembly, debating, counſelling, and admoniſhing one another out of the word of God; and the preaching of the word: becauſe (they ſay) this action of theirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words one another is not authoritative, but meerly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly; is rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Chriſtian conference, then Preaching, and no other then private Chriſtians met together by mutual conſent may perform.</p>
               <p>By all this it appeareth, that it is only an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive publick Miniſterial teaching that their arguments are brought to deny unto men not ordained: for <hi>(Jus Divinum, page</hi> 78.) they uſe theſe words, [It is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative teaching only which we deny.] Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial actings, themſelves oppoſe to Magiſterial; Miniſtry is no more but ſervice: but here they ſeem to oppoſe Miniſterial teaching, unto parental domeſtical teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet they know there is Miniſtration in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents teaching his children, or a Maſter his ſervants; this is ſervice to Chriſt, as well as more publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But take Miniſterial teaching in a ſpecial ſenſe, for the publick diſpenſation of the word. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, What they intend by Authoritative Teaching?</p>
               <p n="1">1 [Authority] is taken ſomtimes for a right or lawful power, enabling to doe ſome publick work; as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120096:26"/>
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Tell us by what [authority] do'ſt thou theſe things?</hi> or, who is he that gave thee this [Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;] <hi>i. e.</hi> by what right, or lawful power, do'ſt thou theſe things? In this ſenſe we think they cannot take it here, becauſe in their deſcription, they reduce it unto the manner of performing the work, and that preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a perſon authorized, and ſo doth the Scripture they alledge for it. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15. The perſon was impowred before he was injoyned to rebuke in this manner; <hi>viz.</hi> with all command, or as they call it Authoritatively. And they need not prove it; for it's granted, that none may preach, but thoſe that have a right and lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe it; but then the queſtion is, Who hath that right and lawful power to preach? We conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this is not that which they intend by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative teaching.</p>
               <p n="2">2. [Authority] is taken for that Majeſty, gravity, fervor, and efficacy that is to attend the diſpenſation of the Goſpel in him that ſpeaketh; as <hi>Mark</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>He taught them as one that had [authority] and not as the Scribes.</hi> Here the manner of Chriſts teaching is ſet forth, it was with [authority] <hi>i. e.</hi> with ſuch gravity, life, and zeal, as it did penetrate and come home to the conſciences of the hearers: and <hi>[not as the Scribes] i. e.</hi> not coldly, ſlightly, or doubtingly. That place which they alledge for authoritative teaching, partly intendeth this. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority,</hi> or <hi>command, i. e.</hi> ſuch as are refractory, rebuke them with ſuch ſeverity, gravity, zeal and fervency, as if it be poſſible may render the word convincing to their conſciences. We ſuppoſe our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do not take [authoritative-teaching] in this ſenſe neither; for undoubtedly all that preach, are to doe it with life and zeal, and to uſe utmoſt endeavors that the Goſpel may come in power to the hearts of thoſe they ſpeak to, that ſo they may not labor in vain.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120096:26"/>
They will not allow gifted Brethren to Preach in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary manner to this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But [Authority] is taken by ſome for that power which an Officer hath over thoſe that he beareth Office to; and becauſe our Brethren in their afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned diſtinctions do oppoſe it unto, and difference it from Brotherly Charitative Teaching, therefore we judge that they take Authoritative teaching, in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for the preaching as Officers, and the exerciſe of Office-power therein. And thoſe two Scriptures which they alledge to prove Authoritative teaching, do both of them ſpeak of preaching Office-wiſe; as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. Only Officers were over the Church of the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> in the Lord; and therefore none but Officers could ſo admoniſh the Church: but we aſſert that gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Members may admoniſh a Church in a Brotherly way, though not as over it in the Lord. So <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 15. This is not only a direction given to <hi>Titus</hi> an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, but alſo about a ſpecial act, wherein he was to put forth Office-power, <hi>viz.</hi> in the caſe of rebukes, When any Church-members were obſtinate, he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected how to exerciſe his Office then, [Rebuke] not only in a Brotherly way, but as over them in the Lord [with command] yea, [with all command.] Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members are obliged to hearken unto admonitions or juſt rebukes from the mouth of any brother. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. But they are under ſpecial and double obligations to hearken unto admonition and juſt rebukes from the mouth of their Officers, becauſe elſe they are guilty of contemning another Ordinance of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation; it becometh a ſin, not only againſt him as a Brother, but as an Officer; it is an offence not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the relation of Brotherhood, but againſt a higher relation, of Office. There is a breaking of their own engagements which they made in committing themſelves to his charge; it's againſt that command, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 17.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120096:27"/>
                  <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi> So that Officers may give ſpecial Commands in the name of Chriſt, to thoſe they bear Office unto, that they obey the will of Chriſt; and may rebuke them with all command for diſobedience.</p>
               <p>An Officer of one Congregation cannot (by any Goſpel-rule that yet we finde) either give ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or rebukes, to the Members of another Church. He may in a Brotherly way, or Charitatively preach on Lecture-dayes, or Lords dayes to another Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tell the Members of it, what Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from them, and urge duty upon the penalty of ſinning againſt God, tell them of the danger of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, or rebuke them in a Brotherly way; but not with all command, not Office-wiſe, becauſe he is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the Lord, for he cannot orderly be an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to many Churches: as a man may tell his neighbors childe of its diſobedience to the parents, or his ſervant of diſobedience to his Maſter; and a gifted man may for a time, upon requeſt, or charitatively, teach all the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, in the School-Maſters abſence; yet not as being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the childe, or ſervant, or Schoole, not as having the charge of them; only the Parents, or Maſter, or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter doe command, or rebuke authoritatively, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet over them.</p>
               <p>Now, if our Brethren take Authoritative Preaching in the ſenſe of the Scriptures they alledge to prove it by, as we ſuppoſe they doe; then their third Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That none may take upon him the Office of the Miniſtry without a call, and that none may do the work of the Miniſtry (authoritatively, <hi>i. e.</hi> Office-wiſe) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination; and all their Arguments to prove it (if they prove no more then they bring them for) may be granted, and yet they have gained nothing againſt the preaching of gifted men without Ordination. For we may ſay, though gifted men may not preach in publick
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120096:27"/>
Aſſemblies, or Churches authoritatively, <hi>i. e.</hi> Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as being over them in the Lord; yet they have authority, <hi>i. e.</hi> a right and lawful power from Chriſt, Charitatively to preach in publick Aſſemblies. In a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly way, they may with life, fervor, and zeal exhort to duty, and ſhew the danger of neglecting it; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke for ſin, not as being over them, but as being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of their eternal good; and Officers out of their own Churches can do no more.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe our Brethren would (as by ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we gather) be underſtood to ſpeak againſt all preaching of gifted men (in ordinary caſes) without Ordination, therefore we ſhall give ſome grounds for it, and anſwer ſuch Arguments as they bring againſt it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein two Arguments are urged, proving the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Preaching of Gifted Brethren, though not ordained.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Our aſſertion is,</p>
               <p>THat ſome men, who are not Ordained Officers, may preach: Or,</p>
               <p>That perſons who have Preaching gifts and Graces, or are apt to teach, may ordinarily exerciſe thoſe gifts in publick Aſſemblies, though they be not ordained Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>This appears by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. From the Antecedaneouſneſs of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Ordination.</p>
               <p>If Election from a Church ought by Goſpel-order to precede, or go before Ordination of Officers; then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not ordained may ordinarily preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:120096:28"/>
But Election ought by Goſpel-order to precede, or go before Ordination of Officers:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Perſons not ordained may ordinarily preach.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Major is cleared thus: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe good experience that a man is gifted for Office, and that his gifts are ſutable to that Church, is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as antecedent to Election, that it cannot be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or regular without it. A Church cannot in faith, elect or chuſe a man, and commit their ſouls to his charge for teaching and overſight, if they have not grounds to perſwade them that he is gifted, and qualified as Chriſt requireth Officers ſhould be. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that his gifts are ſutable, and ſo like to be very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantageous to their ſouls which choſe him. A knowledge of their having ſutable qualifications, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required unto a Churches chuſing of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 3. much more is it neceſſary unto a Churches chuſing one unto a higher Office, to take care of, and feed their ſouls. And becauſe many that are otherwiſe eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifted, yet are not found able to ſpeak publickly unto edification; hence it is impoſſible to gain a knowledge of a mans being endued with ſutable qualifications, without a frequent and ordinary exerciſe of gifts in a way of preaching: a little time will not diſcover it. Therefore an ordinary preaching is pre-requiſite unto Election; and ſo if Election muſt go before Ordination, then it neceſſarily followeth, that ſome men not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may preach.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>They choſe Stephen,—ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Whom they ſet before the Apostles; and when they had prayed, they layd their hands on them.</hi> The Church firſt chuſeth, before they are ordained. Now it is <hi>Mr. Collings</hi> Argument, <hi>(Vind. pag.</hi> 77.) As the Apoſtles ordained Goſpel-preachers, ſo they ought to be ordained. But they uſed ordination after Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore ſo it muſt be uſed. And it's granted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120096:28"/>
by <hi>Mr. Collings</hi> and others <hi>(Vind. pag.</hi> 18) that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is, but <hi>Actus ultimus,</hi> the laſt and perfective Act. And we deſire one Scripture to prove Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Office, as antecedent to Election, or without it. If in any caſe Ordination might go before Election, then either a man might be an Officer to ſome particular Church without their chuſing him; whereas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves grant, <hi>(pag.</hi> 155.) that it is their choice, that maketh one their Miniſter, their Paſtor, their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: Or elſe he might be an Officer, and yet have no particular Church that he beareth Office to; and how abſurd is it to ſay, that a man is a Church-Officer to no Church: Or that a man is an Officer to an Univerſal Church, when yet he is no Officer to any particular Church!</p>
               <p>Neither will their diſtinction of habitual and actual Officers, ſalve this ſore; for if a man preacheth to the Heathen people, as now in <hi>New-England</hi> (which caſe themſelves put, <hi>Jus Divin. pag.</hi> 149.) either he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not as an Officer, but as a gifted Brother, impowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to doe ſuch a work; or elſe he muſt be an actual Officer to no Church; for he actually preacheth to them, though they remain all of them unconverted and no Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. From Goſpel-Commands.</p>
               <p>All that are required by Goſpel-commands to Preach, they may and ought to preach; becauſe elſe they ſin in breaking thoſe Goſpel-Commands that require it of them. But ſome men who are not ordained Officers, are required by Goſpel-Commands to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some men who are not ordained Officers, may and ought to preach.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undenyable; for no man may ſin, or diſobey any Goſpel-Commands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> we prove thus.</p>
               <p>All that have preaching gifts and Graces, or are apt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120096:29"/>
to teach, are required by Goſpel-commands to preach. But ſome men who are not ordained Officers, have preaching gifts and graces, or are apt to Teach. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some men who are not ordained Officers, are required by Goſpel-Commands to preach. The <hi>Minor</hi> is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome men who are not ordained Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, have preaching gifts, or are apt to Teach. For it is a qualification pre-required to a mans being an Officer, that he be apt to Teach. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>A Biſhop then muſt be blameleſs, the husband of one wife, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, ſober, of good behavior, given to hoſpitality [apt to Teach.] Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. None have a ground to Elect and Ordain any, unleſs they be apt to Teach, before they chuſe or ordain them; and therefore many not ordained have preaching gifts. And for Grace, it's as unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major, viz.</hi> That all who have preaching gifts and Graces, or are apt to teach, are required by Goſpel-Commands to preach, we ſhall prove from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 25. The former we ſhall inſiſt upon moſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>As every man hath received a gift, even ſo Miniſter the ſame one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God. If any man Miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, &amp;c.</hi> Where obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods communication of gifts to the Saints. <hi>As every man hath received a [gift]</hi> i. e. any ſpiritual gift; he ſpeaketh indefinitely, and ſo it may include every gift, whether publick or private. It is not limited to one gift, though it be expreſſed in the ſingular number, but may extend to all thoſe gifts which the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth on his people; as 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. it's ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſingular number, <hi>Let [a man] examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread.—[A man]</hi> i. e. every man who approacheth to God in that Ordinance,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120096:29"/>
let him examine himſelf: So [a gift] <hi>i. e.</hi> any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gift, which he hath received from above, let him uſe it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is particularizing of that ſpecial gift of ſpeaking to others edification, in the things of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>If any man [ſpeaketh]</hi> i. e. hath a gift to ſpeak a word of exhortation unto others to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>[Let him ſpeak, as the Oracles of God]</hi> i. e. with reverence, zeal, faithfulneſs, humility, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the word of the Lord to be ſpoken. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this direction how to ſpeak, <hi>viz. as the Oracles of God,</hi> and the reference this hath to the foregoing <hi>verſe,</hi> doe argue, that it is not common ſpeaking, but ſome ſpecial gift of Scripture-interpretation that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and ſo it is uſually carryed by Interpreters. And this aptneſs to teach, being ſo ſuddenly mentioned, or following immediately after, and agreeing ſo ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to what is expreſſed <hi>ver.</hi> 10. hence this 11. <hi>verſe</hi> cannot rationally be denyed to have a ſpecial relation to, and dependance upon <hi>verſe</hi> 10. but muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be an explication, how one particular gift is to be layd out, which is included in that general, <hi>viz.</hi> how thoſe that have a preaching gift ought to uſe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Divine Command to exerciſe ſuch gifts as are received: <hi>[As] every man hath received a gift, ſo Miniſter the ſame one to another.</hi>—Every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever hath ſome gift or other, and that gift which the Lord hath beſtowed in an eminent way, that is he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpecial obligation, to lay out for the Lord. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7. <hi>There are different Gifts: one man excelleth in one gift, another excelleth in another gift;</hi> and that way which a mans gifts eſpecially lyeth, he is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to endeavor the promoting of the intereſt of Chriſt, in the good of others; in that degree that any gift is afforded, in that meaſure is he to lay it out, <hi>[As] he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120096:30"/>
hath received,</hi> ſo he is to Miniſter; he that hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, of him will much be required. Such as a mans gift is, ſuch his Miniſtration ought to be. Of what nature ſoever the gifts be, ſuch the uſe of them muſt be; private gifts are to be uſed privately, and publick gifts <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſuch as are fit for publick uſe) pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; elſe a man doth not Miniſter a gift, as he hath received it; which this Text commandeth. If publick gifts be exerciſed only in a private way, that man doth not give as he hath received: others are without that benefit which they might have by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This command is Univerſal, <hi>i. e.</hi> to all that have ſuch gifts. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>As [every man] hath received a gift.</hi>—and the gift of preaching is inſtanced in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and therefore every man that hath that gift of Scripture-interpretation, is required to Miniſter unto others. We do not ſay, that every Chriſtian is to preach; this Text limiteth the note of Univerſality unto ſuch as have a gift that way: many Chriſtians have not a gift to ſpeak publickly unto edification; but we ſay it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out thus much, that every man who hath that gift, is to Miniſter with it. If a Father commandeth every childe who hath ability to work, and then directeth how to doe ſome particular work; it is undoubted he intendeth that every childe who hath ability to doe that work, ſhould act in it; and that childe which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and doth not ſet about that work, diſobeyeth his father, unleſs his father giveth him a particular diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or prohibition, which the other have not. Now the Lord commandeth that [every Saint] or Steward of his manifold grace, who hath received a gift, ſhould Miniſter with it unto others, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and particularly directeth, how they which have a gift to ſpeak profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unto others, ſhould uſe that gift: <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>He that ſpeaketh, as the Oracles of God.</hi>—and therefore it is to be concluded, he intendeth that every one who is a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120096:30"/>
Steward of his manifold Grace, and hath received ſuch a gift, ſhould Miniſter with it unto others; and he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth if he doth not, unleſs a particular prohibition or diſpenſation be given him, which others have not.</p>
               <p>Here is a general rule requiring every gifted man to preach, and therefore unleſs ſome particular Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can be ſhewn which give a prohibition, or doe forbid all un-ordained mens preaching, every gifted man ought to preach. We doe not ſay barely thus: The preaching of gifted men is nowhere forbidden in the word of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is lawful. But we ſay, By a general command of God, every gifted man is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preach: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Every gifted man who is not forbidden preaching by ſome particular word of God, ought to preach; becauſe elſe he ſinneth in breaking that general command. And in regard the command is not here annexed to Office, but to gifts; it is not ſaid, every man that hath received an Office; but, every man that hath received a gift, let him Miniſter; and this preaching gift is particularized, <hi>ver,</hi> 11. and ſeeing there are many men who are no Officers, nor in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate capacity to be ordained unto Office-work (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not choſen to it by any Church) who yet are eminently gifted, and apt to teach; hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not ordained to Office, may and ought to Preach.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Is not this Text chiefly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of giving of Almes? and is not the <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it be meant chiefly of Almes, then not chiefly of Office: if this worlds goods be the gift, then Office is not the gift; and then it is the calling of any Chriſtian, who hath the gift, to Miniſter with it; and ſo the objector fighteth with himſelf.</p>
               <p>2. Then any Chriſtian who hath this worlds goods may properly be called a Steward; and ſo, that it muſt be adminiſtred as Stewards, is no Argument that Office is intended, as he would make it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:120096:31"/>
3. The Miniſtring of that gift, is to be as Stewards, not of this worlds goods, but of the Grace of God; yea, as Stewards, not of one Grace only, <hi>viz.</hi> Charity; but of the manifold Grace of God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. The Miniſtration is to be of the gift which they are Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of, and that is ſaid to be manifold. In giving of Almes they may ſhew themſelves to be good Stewards of this worlds goods; but not of the manifold grace of God: and therefore giving of Almes cannot be chiefly intended.</p>
               <p>4. It is added, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> And therefore it cannot be meant chiefly of Almes; but the gift of preaching is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be one of thoſe manifold gifts, which every man that hath, is to Miniſter unto others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But here is not only a liberty granted, but a duty enjoyned, ſo that by this Text (if it were to the purpoſe) gifted perſons were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. pa.</hi> 57.</note> bound to preach, and that without Election and calling; for the Churches neglect of their duty, muſt not make him neglect his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We grant it is the duty of gifted perſons to preach, and that this Text holdeth out ſo much. Yet,</p>
               <p>2. It is not here determined either when or where gifted perſons ought to preach. Here is power given to gifted perſons to Preach; and therefore it is lawful for them to doe it: yea, it is commanded, and ſo they ſin if they will not doe it. But other things muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur before the exerciſe of this power at this time or in that place. This diſtinction our Brethren <hi>(Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 144.) give us, and ſo we ſhall pay them with ſuch coyn, as they would have us take. We di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh (ſay they) between a Miniſter of Chriſt, and a Miniſter of Chriſt in ſuch a place; between the Office it ſelf, and the ordinary exerciſe of it, to ſuch or ſuch
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120096:31"/>
a people: ſo we diſtinguiſh betwixt the preaching of a gifted perſon in ſuch a place; between his power to exrciſe his gifts, and his power to exerciſe his gifts to ſuch or ſuch a people, or at ſuch a time. Suppoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination did make an Officer, or a Miniſter, then all thoſe Goſpel-Commands that require it of Officers, that they diligently and conſtantly preach, they not onely give a man, who is ordained, liberty; but injoyn it as a duty, that, he preacheth in this manner. But if this man either by baniſhment, or the unjuſt rejection of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, be put out of imployment, and be caſt into ſome place, where his gifts are not deſired; none giveth him a ſpecial call to exerciſe his gifts for a great while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in ſuch caſes, our Brethren will not ſay, that he hath ſinned or broken thoſe Commands when he would have preached, if others would have heard. So gifted perſons are enjoyned to preach, yet if they be not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, or deſired to exerciſe their gifts a great while together, they may not ſin; and if other things do not concur to open a door, or give an opportun y to preach at this time, or in this or that place; their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may not be neglected, or that command broken. Our Brethren grant, that men ordained have not power to adminiſter the Ordinances of Chriſt, without a ſpecial call. <hi>Jus Divin. pag.</hi> 144.</p>
               <p>Gifted perſons have power to preach; and the Churches calling, or deſiring them to exerciſe their gifts, may be ſufficient to give an opportunity to preach; yea, the deſire of a particular perſon ſometimes may be enough, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 34, 35. <hi>And the</hi> Eunuch <hi>anſwered</hi> Philip, <hi>and ſaid, [I pray thee] of whom ſpeaketh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet this? of himſelf, or of ſome other man. Then</hi> Philip <hi>opened his mouth, and began at the ſame Scripture, and [preached] unto him, Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>Eunuchs</hi> requeſt [I <hi>pray thee—]</hi> was ſufficient to give <hi>Philip</hi> an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:120096:32"/>
Yea, the deſire even of an unbeleeving Magiſtrate in ſome caſes may give opportunity to exerciſe ones gifts in a way of preaching. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The Deputy of the Country</hi> Sergius Paulus <hi>a prudent man called for</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>and [deſired] to hear the word of God.</hi>—and <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Then the Deputy—beleeved, being astoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the doctrine of the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>The rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, Ye men and Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on. Then</hi> Paul <hi>stood up, &amp;c.</hi> The deſire or call of a Magiſtrate or Miniſter; yea, the deſire of the people, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 44. may be call ſufficient in ſome caſes to exerciſe a mans gifts in a way of preaching. But when a gifted perſon hath no ſuch call to exerciſe his gifts, he doth not ſin in not preaching, though poſſibly others may ſin in not deſiring him to preach.</p>
               <p>3. In ſuch caſes there ought to be a waiting in the uſe of means to ſatisfie the Church, before the exerciſe of gifts; though it be a duty in it ſelf, and a Church may ſin in hindring a man from preaching, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church or elſewhere; yet at this or that time it may not be his duty to doe it, until other duties be done. It is his duty to uſe means to ſatisfie the Church, that he may act in it without offence to that; and until this be done, we conceive it is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately his duty, in caſe of a Churches diſſatisfaction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his ability to preach.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> A particular exception is enough to reſtrain any general rule. Women are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and that is one limitation of this general rule. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. But let it be ſhewn, where all men, not ordained, are forbidden preaching: without ſuch a particular exception, every gifted man may preach,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120096:32"/>
and find a warrant for it from that general rule. It's ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16. The Lord God commanded the man, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Of [every tree] of the garden thou mayſt freely eat.</hi> But will Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> ſay, That this will prove that <hi>Adam</hi> might <hi>(i. e.</hi> lawfully) eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>[Of every tree?]</hi>—doth not the particular exception, <hi>v.</hi> 17. limit that general rule, <hi>v.</hi> 16? It's ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Ye may [all] propheſie,</hi>—will he therefore ſay, Women may propheſie in the Churches? and doth not [all] bring them in here, as much as it doth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10.? Every gifted man not excepted by ſome particular rule, may preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. If all that have gifts and abilities to preach, may do it, then thoſe who are fitted with abilities to be Generals of an Army, or Captains, or Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or Pleaders at the Bar, may do the work of Generals, Captains, and Parliament-men, and plead at the Bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thoſe that have abilities for civil or military imployments, may exerciſe thoſe abilities, if a King or Supream Governour doth command them to do it: He that hath abilities to be a Captain, may do the work of a Captain, if the General biddeth him. He may do the work of a General of an Army, or a Parliament-man, or a Pleader at the Bar, (being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with abilities) if the King, or thoſe who are to appoint unto ſuch works, do impower him thereunto. Now, Chriſt the King of Saints, and the great Captain-General of our Salvation, who had all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in Heaven and Earth given unto him, he hath commanded every man that hath grace, and is gifted, to preach; and therefore, every man who hath Grace, and is gifted, may Preach.</p>
               <p>2. He that doth the work of a General of an Army,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120096:33"/>
aſſumeth an office in the Army; the General is the chief Officer there. And he that doth the work of a Parliament-man, aſſumeth the office of a Magiſtrate: and ſo the Argument is impertinent. We grant that Election and Ordination both, are neceſſary in Order before the exerciſe of gifts Office-wiſe.</p>
               <p>3. Our Argument is not taken from a general Rule onely, but from a particularizing of Preaching gifts therewith, when a general Command is given to every man who hath a gift, to miniſter with it unto others; and one gift is particularly mentioned, then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted, that every man who hath that particular gift ought to miniſter with it, unleſs he falleth under ſome ſpecial prohibition: and let our Brethren ſhew any ſuch prohibition, elſe their conſequence is not good. And let this alwayes be obſerved; it is not Gifts, but Chriſt (by Goſpel-Rules) that warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and giveth the Authority or power to gifted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to preach. Gifts do qualifie and enable a perſon to the Act. Chriſt by Goſpel Rules warranteth the acting in that way. Gifts (with graces) are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, that the perſon is warranted or authorized to Preach: Charity bindeth to follow Goſpel-Rules in the exerciſe of gifts for the good of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. Every one is to uſe his gift with reſpect to the gift it ſelf, and to his place and calling, and no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpiritual gifts are to be exerciſed by every one in his own Sphere, <hi>(Jus Divinum, pag.</hi> 102.) by private perſons, privately; by thoſe that are in Office, publickly, and in the Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> private perſons, yet of eminent gifts (inſomuch as they knew the way of Chriſt more perfectly then <hi>Apollos</hi> himſelf—) kept their own place; they as gifted Chriſtians did not undertake to preach publickly, but took him to them, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120096:33"/>
expounded to him the way of God more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. This is a notable pattern for private Chriſtians, even of the higheſt form to walk by; in this way, that they may find imployment for all their gifts. Thoſe women whom the Apoſtle honours with the Title of Labourers with him in the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. they laboured not by publick preaching, for this the Apoſtle permits not to women, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. but by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advertiſements and Admonitions as opportunities were adminiſtrd.</p>
               <p>Therefore it follows not, that becauſe all gifts are to be improved, therefore a gifted Brother may preach: for, firſt, there are other ways of making uſe of our moſt excellent gifts, then by preaching onely; and ſecondly, it is required in him that will preach warrantably; not onely that he be fitted for the work; but that he be appointed to the Office of the miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The third Anſwer to the foregoing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may ſerve here alſo; if it will not follow, that becauſe all gifts are to be improved, therefore a gifted Brother may preach; yet it will follow, that becauſe every man is to miniſter unto others, that gift he hath received, and the gift of preaching is particularized: therefore every man who hath that gift, is to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with it, <hi>i. e.</hi> is to preach; and that is our Argument, from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
               <p>2. The Examples of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> do not at all deny the lawfulneſs of any gifted mans preaching publickly. Becauſe they did this privately; therefore they might not preach publickly: it doth not follow. The Apoſtles preached privated, in every houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 42. but it did not follow, that therefore they might not preach publickly: for, in the ſame <hi>verſe</hi> they are ſaid to teach in the Temple alſo. And as to the caſe alledged:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not determined whether <hi>Aquila</hi> had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120096:34"/>
gifts, or were apt to teach publickly or not: it is frequently found in our experience, that perſons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently qualified for the giving private Advertiſements and Admonitions, yet are not gifted to ſpeak publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto Edification. Our queſtion is, Whether ſuch as have publick gifts, may not uſe them in a publick way of preaching? It is not proved that <hi>Aquila</hi> had ſuch gifts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was a particular perſon, <hi>Apollo,</hi> that was by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> at this time to be inſtructed; and therefore rules of expediency require that it ſhould be in a private way. If <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> had been Eccleſiaſtical Officers, it had been expedient to inſtruct <hi>Apollo</hi> privately. If an Officer heareth another preach, and perceiveth by his ſpeaking, that he is much unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſome way of Chriſt; were it according to Goſpel-order for that Officer to tell him publickly, and before all the Congregation, that he doth not underſtand the way of the Lord, and to direct him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it? Becauſe one man, <hi>viz. Apollo,</hi> was inſtructed more perfectly in the way of the Lord, by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> in a private way: for any to ſay, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtians who have publick gifts, may not preach in a publick way, when many deſire inſtruction from them; how feeble is this Conſequence?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though private inſtruction be one way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving eminent gifts, yet it doth not follow, that this is the chief, much leſs the onely way, wherein the Lord would have any man be always improving publick gifts, <hi>i. e.</hi> gifts fit for publick uſe. If <hi>Aquila</hi> had publick gifts, becauſe at this time he uſed them in a private way, it doth not follow, that he always did ſo; and therefore this ſingle act can be no warrant to any that have publick gifts to find imployment for all their gifts, alwayes, privately. Thoſe women, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. if they laboured in the Goſpel, by private
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:120096:34"/>
Advertiſements and Admonitions, ſeeing ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exception, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. cannot be found forbidding gifted mens preaching: and ſeeing it is not expreſſed what gifts thoſe women had; hence its far ſhort of proving, that publick or preaching gifts, may always be made uſe of, in a private way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We apprehend that it will neceſſarily follow, that becauſe all gifts <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſpiritual gifts) are to be improved, therefore a gifted Brother may preach. Or rather, in the words of that text, <hi>Becauſe every man that hath received a gift, is to miniſter with it;</hi> therefore every gifted Brother may preach.</p>
               <p>Abilities to preach are called gifts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Having then [gifts] differing—and <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exhorting are put amongſt thoſe gifts. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 8. And our Brethren <hi>(Jus Divinum, p.</hi> 102.) grant, that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. extendeth to all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts. Now [all gifts] include theſe preaching gifts; and how will the Conſequence be avoided? Every man that hath preaching gifts is to improve them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> every gifted Brother <hi>(i. e.</hi> with thoſe preaching gifts) is to preach. For preaching gifts are not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, unleſs there be preaching.</p>
               <p>Neither the examples of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, Act.</hi> 18. nor of thoſe women, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. do intimate that there are ways of making uſe of preaching gifts, which will excuſe from ſin, if they preach not. There cannot be an improvement of any gifts without an uſe of them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 25, 27. There is not an uſing of preaching gifts, or not for their proper end, if there be no preaching; and therefore, if all that have preaching gifts do not preach, then all gifts are not improved, or every man doth not miniſter that gift which he hath received.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It belongeth to his place and calling who hath preaching gifts, to exerciſe thoſe gifts in a way of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:120096:35"/>
Preaching, and that publickly, as opportunity is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: The chief weight of the Objection lieth here: Our Brethren ſuppoſe that it is a going out of their Sphere, out of their place and calling, for any that are not in Office, to exerciſe their gifts in a way of preaching; eſpecially if it be publickly. Whereas that place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. determineth it to belong unto his place and calling who hath received ſuch a gift, to miniſter with it. The commanding every man to uſe that gift he hath, is a determining it to be every mans place and calling to preach who hath that gift. Thoſe men which do not uſe their gifts, do diſobey this Command which extendeth to every man. But we ſhall adde ſeveral other Conſiderations, which (taken together) may ſerve for the evincing this; that it appertaineth to their Sphere, place and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who have ſuch gifts to preach, and that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It belongeth to the place and calling of perſons gifted (though not in Office, to do the ſame work for ſubſtance, that Officers do in their preaching. Our Brethren in their Diſcription of preaching, ſay, <hi>(Ius Divinum, p.</hi> 72.) The Subject of preaching is, the Word of God: and the work of preaching is, the Explication and Application of this Word: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons gifted, who are not in Office, may lawfully do all this; and for the proper end of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort of thoſe they ſpeak to, a privite Brotherly teaching. Admoniſhing and Exhorting, they grant <hi>(pag.</hi> 78.) to be duty, and they exhort and charge their people not to neglect it. Perſons gifted, though not in Office, may exhort others, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>But [exhort] one another dayly,</hi>—They may rebuke others, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke] thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> They may teach and admoniſh others, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Let the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120096:35"/>
word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all wiſdom, [teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admoniſhing one another.]</hi>—Theſe laſt recited words, may be referred to the foregoing, as well as the following words. The Apoſtle would have the Word of Chriſt ſo dwell in Chriſtians, as they may teach and admoniſh one another; and the following words may properly be read thus <hi>[Singing in pſalmes, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, with grace in your hearts to the Lord:]</hi> The Grammatical conſtruction of the words doth not at all enforce it, that the teaching <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zanch. Coloſ.</hi> 3.</note> and admoniſhing ſhould be in or by ſinging of Pſalmes. From this place <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerveth that Chriſtians are bound to reach and exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privately: yea, perſons gifted, though not in Office, may expound the way of God to others. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> took <hi>Apollo</hi> unto them, and <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 26. [expounded] unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p>
               <p>That all the forementioned places hold out the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of porſons out of Office, may eaſily be perceived by any judicious Reader: for the exhortations are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected generally to believers, and even thoſe that moſt ſtiffly oppoſe the preaching of men out of Office, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſo much, and therefore we ſhall not inſiſt on the proof of that: the very Objection we are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, aſſerteth <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> to be private perſons.</p>
               <p>That thoſe acts of Exhorting, Rebuking, Teaching, Admoniſhing, Expounding,—are the ſame, for ſubſtance with Preaching, is alſo clear; for, theſe acts cannot be performed without an Explication and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Word of God; <hi>Aquila</hi> could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the way of God to <hi>Apollo,</hi> without an opening and applying of the Word to him, and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 16. It is in and by the opening and applying that Word of Chriſt unto others, which is within them, that they are t
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:120096:36"/>
teach and admoniſh one another. And the work of Officers when they preach, is expreſſed by the ſame words that are uſed in theſe places to expreſs the acts of men not in Office; and therefore the works are the ſame; though we do not ſay, That the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acting is the ſame in all reſpects. Officers preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is exhorting, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and [ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort.]</hi> It is admoniſhing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>are over you in the Lord, and [admoniſh] you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth, that perſons gifted, not in Office, may do the ſame work, that is called preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet in this they do not act out of their Sphere, place or calling. And we cannot ſee how it can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, the name or title of preaching, when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the Word of God; the Work, the Explication, and Application of the Word: the End, the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Comfort of others, as it is in the preaching of Officers.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren do grant that all this may be done by men not in Office, but they deny, That they may do it Authoritatively: and this we may grant them alſo, if by Authoritative, they mean Office-wiſe. It is enough to our purpoſe if they may do it charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They deny that it is the place and calling of gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men not in Office, to perform theſe acts [publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;] they grant they may in private: we have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may do the work of preaching; and if we can prove that it belongeth to their place and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do this work publickly, it is as much as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for; and divers of the enſuing Conſiderations ſhall be chiefly to evince that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every Church-member ſuſtaineth a relation to the whole Church he is fixed in; and it belongeth to the place and calling of every gifted brother to teach, exhort, admoniſh every member thereof, as occaſion is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:120096:36"/>
offered: there is ſome duty that every member oweth to the whole Church; thoſe that are moſt eminently gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet have need of the helps, aſſiſtances, experiences, &amp; prayers, of the weakeſt and meaneſt Members in gifts and abilities. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>The head cannot ſay to the feet, I have no need of you.</hi>—thoſe members of the body which ſeem to be more feeble, are neceſſary: and that thoſe duties of teaching and exhorting (which are the ſame for ſubſtance with preaching Office-wiſe) are required from every gifted perſon towards all fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members, the aforementioned Scriptures will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 16. They are urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the general directions which were given to thoſe Churches, not amongſt domeſtical or family-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Rebuke [thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.]</hi> Not only thoſe in a mans own houſe; but neighbors. And ſeeing a gifted Brother may exhort and admoniſh all the Members of the Church ſeverally, why may he not doe it when they are together?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A publick gift cannot be fully improved, nor Gods end in giving it be fully anſwered, if it be uſed only in a private way: the nature of the gift ſheweth that the chief uſe of it ſhould be in a publick way. A talent [is hidden] when it is not uſed in ſome way of proportion to the talent it ſelf, as well as when it is not uſed at all; and they are unfaithful ſervants that hide their Talents. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 25, 26. <hi>Unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required. Luk.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 48. And if the Lord hath beſtowed a gift fit for publick uſe, and it hath been cooped up, and uſed onely privately; there much is given, and little (in compariſon of what might be, if it were uſed in a publick way) is returned. A gift might in a publick uſe of it, reach many, that in a private uſe of it, can reap no advantage by it; and ſo there is a hiding a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. A man doth not Miniſter his gift, or not as he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:120096:37"/>
hath received, if he uſeth a publick gift, onely in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way.</p>
               <p>And Gods end in affording a publick gift is not onely a mans own private advantage, or the benefit of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but the publick advantage of the whole Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every man to profit withal.</hi> He ſpeaketh of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, and not a mans family onely; for all the gifts particularized, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. were to be layd out for the profit of the Church; and the ſcope of the <hi>Chapter</hi> ſheweth, that a publick profiting with gifts is intended. And the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given, not to Officers only, but to every man, for this end, that he may profit withal. Every man that enjoyeth thoſe eminent manifeſtations of the Spirit, thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent gifts of the Spirit; to whom is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom, or the word of knowledge, as <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> to whomſoever the Spirit hath afforded a gift, either wiſely to ſpeak, and apply Goſpel-truths to the ſouls of others, for the uſes and ends they ſerve to; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various conditions, ſtreights, exigencies, neceſſities, temptations, which they are in, that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to; or underſtandingly to give an expoſition of the Scriptures, every man that hath ſuch gifts, it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his place and calling, to uſe thoſe gifts for the common good of the Church, or for the beſt advantage and profit thereof, elſe he croſſeth the end of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in beſtowing thoſe gifts, which is, that he might profit with them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Publick actings are not peculiar to Office, and therefore it cannot argue, that a man not in Office, goeth out of his place and calling, becauſe he acteth publickly: one great ground of their miſtake ſeemeth to lie here, they ſuppoſe (but they have not proved it from any Scripture) that publickneſs in acting, or in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is limitted and reſtrained to Officers onely; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:120096:37"/>
gifts are to be exerciſed (ſay they, <hi>Jus Div. p.</hi> 102.) by every one in his own Sphere, by private perſons pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, by thoſe that are in Office publickly, and in the Congregation. Whereas publickneſs doth not make an Act to be an Act of Office, nor privateneſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being ſo. An Officer may put forth Acts of Office privately; as, when he rebuketh or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth a Brother as one ſet over him in the Lord, though it be not before the Congregation, yet ſurely it is an Act of Office. The Act may be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Office-wiſe in a private houſe, as we proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The publickneſs of the Act doth neither make it preaching, nor (as they call it) Authoritative preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore gifted Brethren cannot be ſaid to aſſume the Office of a Paſtor or Teacher, becauſe they exhort and admoniſh publickly. Alſo in many caſes a man not in Office may act either in civil or religious matters publickly, and ſo may exerciſe both natural and ſpiritual gifts, when yet he taketh no Office upon him, nor goeth out of his Sphere. As, in any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of publick concernment to a Town, the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof is committed chiefly to the Officers of the Town or place; yet another man of eminent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities, and fit for the management of ſuch a work, (though he be no Officer) may be called in for aſſiſtance, or may act publickly in the caſe. Conſtables may ordinarily call in others, for their aſſiſtance in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick works; and ſo, in many other caſes, men that are no Officers, may do the ſame works that Officers do, either alone, or as Aſſiſtants, and that publickly.</p>
               <p>It is an ordinary thing for men to diſtribute worldly goods openly in publick Aſſemblies, to the uſe of poor Neighbours, or of ſuch as live at a diſtance, who have ſuſtained loſſes by fire; and it is not unlike that they did it publickly, <hi>Act. 11. v.</hi> 29, 30. Now it is the work
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120096:38"/>
of a Deacon (who is a Church-Officer) to diſtribute: our Brethren interpret that ſo, <hi>Rom. 12 v. 8. [He that giveth]</hi> i. e. the Deacon; and if <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Regim. pag.</hi> 125.</note> any man may do the ſame work publickly which a Deacon by his Office doth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going out of his place and calling; why may not a gifted Brother do part of the ſame work, which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officer doth? why may he not teach and exhort, and that publickly, without going out of his place and calling alſo? Nay, Church-Members that were not in Office, did publickly act in that Aſſembly. <hi>Act. 15. v. 12. Then all the multitude kept ſilence</hi>—This neceſſarily impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the multitude did ſpeak before in the Aſſembly; and it cannot be reſtrained unto Officers onely, for the whole Church did help to make up the multitude in that Aſſembly, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders, with [the whole Church] to ſend choſen men of their own Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There [Church] is diſtinguiſhed from Apoſtles and Elders, which were the Officers; and the Church is ſaid to Co-operate with the Apoſtles and Elders in thoſe publick acts of chooſing and ſending Meſſengers. So <hi>verſe</hi> 23. All which doth fully prove, that it belongeth to the Sphere, Place, and Calling of men not in Office, to act in religious matters [publickly:] and therefore unleſs ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Goſpel-Rule can be found, forbidding gifted men to teach or exhort publickly, it will not appear that they go out of their Sphere therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Charity bindeth ſometimes, to an acting occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally in ſome works that belong not to a mans own, but anothers Calling; and then it cannot be a going out of his Sphere to act therein: in civil employments, what is more ordinary, then for a man of one Calling, upon requeſt to do the work of another mans Calling? yea, to leave his own work, to do work for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Yea in publick employments, who queſtioneth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120096:38"/>
the lawfulneſs of a gifted mans tending a School, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, for a few days, at the requeſt of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter? and this is a publick work; and yet a man that is no Schoolmaſter doth not go out of his Sphere, Place, or Calling herein, though he doth the work occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, that belongeth not to his own, but anothers Calling. And why may not gifted men as well preach in publick, without any ſinful going out of their Sphere, Place, or Calling?</p>
               <p>Charity putteth upon doing good to others to the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our ability, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. v. 3. 1 Joh. 3. 16. We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren;</hi> and therefore ſurely Charity calleth to lay out a mans gifts for the good of others, to the utmoſt of the gift and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; it is leſs to lay out gifts, then to lay down life.</p>
               <p>And if a man hath publick gifts, and doth not uſe them publickly, he neither acteth to the utmoſt of his gifts, nor layeth them out in that way wherein he may moſt promote the good of others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may lawfully chooſe it for his Calling to preach, if he be gifted and qualified according to Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Rules for the work; and then it is no going out of his Sphere, Place or Calling, to Preach: Some men from their Childhood have an inclination to that work of the Miniſtry, and ſpend many years in preparation for it in the Univerſities, and elſewhere; are bleſſed with Grace and gifts fit for the employment; they can finde no rule for Ordination unto Office, until a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Election from a Church: how can it be a going out of their Calling to Preach, who never owned any other Calling but that? if Ordination did give the Call to the Office, yet would it hardly be proved that it made it a mans Calling to Preach, or that he could not have that as his Calling without Ordination. Men may (being fitted for that work) many years Preach
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120096:39"/>
(for ought we finde) in order to, or before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Office, if they have no Call from a Church unto Office, or no ſuch Call as they can with clearneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, in that time: for, every man is to miniſter his gift; which warranteth a conſtant as well as an occaſional uſe of gifts, as opportunity is offered.</p>
               <p>And the ſame is to be ſaid for men who have uſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Callings; if they be gifted for the work of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have a Diſpoſition thereunto, and the Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth a door for a conſtant uſe of thoſe gifts, then they may lawfully leave their other vocations, and then they go not out of their Place or Calling if they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily preach, it being become their Calling to do it. That place ſpeaketh much this way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be Teachers, ye have need that one teach you again,</hi>—This implyeth that thoſe Chriſtians who are not Teachers, and ſo are of other Callings, (for Chriſtians are not to live without Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) may afterwards (being gifted) become Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and ſo may change their Callings, or elſe preach, and hold other Callings too. Yea, it importeth that it is the duty of Chriſtians to endeavour after ſuch a growth in grace and experience, as they may become Teachers. As the Apoſtle exhorreth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to covet that they might propheſie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 39. ſo here he exhorteth the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to covet to teach, or to be Teachers. And it's not like that private teaching is only or chiefly intended; for though theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> were believers, yet he denyeth them to be Teachers in the ſenſe he intended, for <hi>verſe</hi> 12. he blameth them that they were not Teachers, but needed milk; and therefore he meaneth ſuch Teachings as babes in Chriſt do not attain unto, and ſuch as is reached unto, by long time or much experience: <hi>[for the time,]</hi> i. e. conſidering how long it is ſince your firſt converſion to Chriſt, <hi>ye ought to be Teachers.</hi> Whereas all Chriſtians,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120096:39"/>
even babes in Chriſt, are Teachers in that private bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly way; as themſelves grant, <hi>(Jus Divinum, p.</hi> 78.) it's the common duty of all Chriſtians, and preſcribed to all, even to women, by the Law of God, under pain of ſin. Onely grown Chriſtians of long time or much experience are the Teachers the Apoſtle here intendeth, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. And therefore more then teaching in a private brotherly way is intended: and either they muſt hold two Callings, or elſe leave their worldly Calling, to give up themſelves to teaching.</p>
               <p>Some do alledge againſt the preaching of men that have followed other Callings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling, wherein he was called.</hi> Whereas this Text doth neither forbid an occaſional doing the work of anothers, nor the changing of ones own Calling. The meaning is, Let him abide with God in his Calling; and ſo it is interpreted, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Brethren, let every man wherein he is called, therein [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with God.]</hi> He doth not forbid changing or leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Calling, but the leaving or forſaking God; the thing blamed, is a not abiding with God in a mans Calling. The occaſion of this Exhortation appeareth to be this: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> queſtioned the lawfulneſs of a believers Co-habitation with an unbelieving Yoke-fellow; and the lawfulneſs of that; the Apoſtle aſſerted in the former part of the Chapter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to lay down a general rule, which reacheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relations, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling</hi>—i. e. it's lawful for him to continue in the ſame condition or courſe of life that he was in, when he was called or converted: his being called doth not free him from or deſtroy his relation to Infidels and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers: many temptations will be met withal from the Infidels or unbelievers to whom the relation is, to a leaving the Lord and his wayes; but this doth not break the relation, or free from keeping Covenant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120096:40"/>
with the unbeliever; and therefore let him abide in the ſame Calling, onely let him be careful to abide with God therein. If one be not in relation to Infidels or unbelievers, it's beſt (as much as may be) to keep free; but if when one is called or converted, he be in relation to ſuch, let him abide in that Calling; yet ſo as to abide with God. He inſtanceth in the relation of a ſervant, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Art thou called being a ſervant?</hi> i. e. if thou be'ſt a ſervant to an unbelieving maſter when thou art called, <hi>[care not for it:]</hi> i. e. diſtract not thy ſelf about, do not ſcruple or queſtion the lawfulneſs of thy continuance, or Co-habitation with him: <hi>[but if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather:]</hi> i. e. if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer will releaſe thee of thy ſervice, and of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to dwell with him, thou had'ſt better be free; it's better to have Communion with &amp; relation to believers, then to unbelievers. So that ſeeing the Apoſtle inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in ſervants, <hi>v.</hi> 21. &amp; biddeth them continue or abide in that Calling, <hi>i. e.</hi> courſe of life, they were in when call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as one particular included in that general, <hi>v.</hi> 20. hence he doth not forbid here, the changing of ones Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or condition of life; for, he that is now a ſervant, may lawfully marry, and become a maſter of ſervants. As well may they aſſert from <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. that he who is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, muſt abide always a ſervant; as that he who is now of ſome worldly Calling, muſt abide in that, and not preach.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Gifted men have a Divine allowance to teach and exhort publickly; and therefore they go not out of their Sphere, Place, or Calling therein. There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is: but exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another</hi>—Here is a command to keep up Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an meetings, or Church-aſſemblies [not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together.] And there is a duty commanded to be performed in theſe publick aſſemblies,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120096:40"/>
                  <hi>[but exhorting one another.—]</hi> The particle [but] ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth that this hath reference unto the foregoing words; he telleth us that the manner of ſome was to forſake the aſſemblings of themſelves together; and in Oppoſition to them it's added, <hi>[but exhorting—]</hi> i. e. but do you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to exhort one another. And it is not limited or reſtrained to Officers, that they onely ſhould give Exhortations in theſe publick aſſemblies, but it's left upon the Chriſtians in general to exhort one another; the ſame perſons that are to provoke one another unto love and good works, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and the ſame perſons that are to aſſemble together, <hi>v.</hi> 25. it's left amongſt them as a duty in their aſſemblings together, to exhort one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and therefore it cannot be limited to Officers. Any men that had abilities to exhort unto Edification, here had a liberty granted, to give Exhortations in theſe publick aſſemblies; here is no exception of any, that all might be provoked to cover gifts which enable to the duty.</p>
               <p>Yet we do not think that every individual Chriſtian did give Exhortations in thoſe aſſemblies, but only ſuch as were gifted; becauſe they onely were able to exhort unto Edification, which was the end of the meeting. It was not unlawful for any (that we can finde) if they were able to do the work: they that cannot do it, cannot be ſuppoſed to be required to do it. As for Women, they are excepted elſewhere. It's certain that more then Officers are intended, for not Officers onely, but all in the Church are to beware of forſaking the aſſembling of themſelves together; and the duty of exhorting one another lieth in general amongſt thoſe that are to aſſemble, and is not limited to Officers more then the duty of aſſembling. If a Father doth bid his Children meet together, and do ſuch a work; as it is ſuppoſed he doth not require a Child in the Cradle to meet with the reſt, or to do the work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120096:41"/>
it hath not ability: ſo it is ſuppoſed that any, or all who are able to do it, may, or ought to ſet about it. And, how can thoſe who are able to exhort others in publick aſſemblies, free themſelves from diſobedience to this command, which is left in general amongſt them, if they do it not publickly? Alſo there is example for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Apollo</hi> ſpake, i. e. preached <hi>[in the Synagogue,]</hi> i. e. publickly; and <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>He mightily convinced the Jews, and that [publickly.]</hi> And that <hi>Apollo</hi> was not at this time in Office, or was not ordained, but acted herein as a gifted perſon, we ſhall ſhew afterward. And this proveth that gifted perſons do not act out of their Sphere, Place, or Calling, in preaching publickly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> By Gift, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. it is very probable may be meant Office: for, 1. He ſays it muſt be adminiſtred as Stewards. 2. The Apoſtle <note place="margin">M. Collings. page 57.</note> inſtancing in particulars, <hi>v.</hi> 11. inſtanceth in two acts of Office, Exhorting and Miniſtring, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 8. and if ſo, the meaning is onely this: As any one hath received any Office in the Church, ſo let him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.—</p>
               <p>Others <hi>(Jus Divinum, page</hi> 103.) ſpeak thus: <hi>v.</hi> 11. doth not permit every gifted man to be a Preacher, but direct every Preacher in the right Diſpenſation of that weighty Office: <hi>[he that ſpeaketh,]</hi> i. e. he that by publick Authority is rightly ordained to ſpeak. And thus ſome reſtraine the word gift, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>[a gift,]</hi> i. e. an Office; and that not without probability: for ſo the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are taken, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gifts,</hi> which the Apoſtle in the verſes following expounds of Officers. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Neglect not this gift</hi>—i. e. the Office, if the Apoſtle may be his own interpreter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>This charge I commit to thee, Son Timothy, according to the prophecies that went before of thee,</hi> &amp;c.—So <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>To me—is this grace given, that

                  </gap>. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Grace and Apoſtleſhip,</hi> i. e. The grace of Apoſtleſhip. The order which the Apoſtle maketh between Gifts, Adminiſtrations, and Operations, they would have taken notice of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. Gifts qualifie for Miniſtries, Miniſtry authorizeth for Operation. A Phyſitian might not judge of Leproſies, though he had skill; nor a Butcher kill the Sacrifice, though he knew how; theſe things belonged to the Prieſt: nor every gifted Brother undertake either the Office or the work of a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thoſe verſes have relation to, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon each other; for, thoſe are gifts which are mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 11. and Miniſtration is required in both <hi>verſes;</hi> and ſo the meaning is plain, <hi>[he that ſpeaketh]</hi> i. e. he that hath a Gift to ſpeak to Edification, or Preach. And this ſpeaking being one gift which muſt be reduced to the general rule, <hi>v.</hi> 10. (as the connexion of the verſes ſheweth) hence [every man] that hath that gift, (with grace) is permitted, yea, commanded to preach, or to miniſter his gift. Some would evade the Argument by taking the word <hi>[gift]</hi> for Office; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall anſwer further.</p>
               <p>2. Neither the Context, nor the Subſequent verſes, can be reſtrained unto Officers; neither doth it appear by the verſes themſelves, that the perſons are changed who are ſpoken to; and therefore the word <hi>gift, v.</hi> 10. cannot be limited to Office: The Apoſtle exhorteth to Sobriety, and watchfulneſs unto prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>To charity, v.</hi> 8. <hi>To hoſpitality v.</hi> 9. <hi>Uſe hoſpitality one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother without grudging.</hi>

               <p>All theſe Exhortations were plainly directed to Chriſtians in general: for ſurely none will ſay, That onely Officers were to be ſober, or to watch unto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or to have charity, or to uſe hoſpitality. And the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120096:42"/>
perſons ſpoken to, are the ſame, <hi>v.</hi> 10. He ſpake in the foregoing verſes to all the Saints, and continueth his ſpeech in general terms to the ſame perſons, <hi>[as every man—]</hi> and that by this <hi>[every man]</hi> ſhould be meant Officers onely, who were very few in compariſon of thoſe before ſpoken to, how unconceivable a thing is it? eſpecially ſeeing no diſtinguiſhing Character is laid down to notifie Officers alone to be intended; it is not ſaid, As every Paſtor, Elder, or Overſeer hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a gift, nor as every man hath received an Office; but he writeth to the ſcattered Saints in general, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and urgeth duties in common, upon all of them in the foregoing verſes; and what a rupture would it make in the Text, to thruſt in an Exhortation only to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, without any plain nomination of them, and in terms applicable to all that were before ſpoken to? [e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one] includeth all the Chriſtians, as well as Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; [Gift] may be applied to others alſo; for, all believers have ſome gifts which they are to uſe, and ſome that are no Officers, have eminent gifts; and therefore it is a ſafe interpretation to take it for every individual perſon that is gifted: and the taking ſuch a general expreſſion, in ſo reſtrained a ſenſe, that moſt who have gifts, ſhould be excluded, or not intended, when the notification of the perſons to whom the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation belongeth, is by the word [Gift,] and when it runneth in general terms, <hi>[every one—]</hi> this were a dangerous way of interpretation of other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Let [every man] prove his own works,</hi>—were it not dangerous to ſay, that here, but a few men, or onely Officers, are required to prove their own works?</p>
               <p>And how any of thoſe, to whom this Epiſtle was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, who had received gifts, and eminent gifts, could in faith or groundedly conclude that this Exhortation did not belong to them, becauſe they were not Officers,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120096:42"/>
or that [every one] ſhould not include them, we finde not.</p>
               <p>3. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh indefinitely [a gift] and an indefinite propoſition is equipollent uſually to an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, ſo it may be extended to all gifts in general, and therefore cannot without ſome ſpecial reaſon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to one particular gift, <hi>viz.</hi> Office: there is much in the Text to forbid the limiting of it to Office, as we have ſhewn; and there is nothing in the Text to inforce or prove, that it muſt be meant of Office; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to ſwerve from right rules of interpretation, to take gift for Office in this place; for (by theſe) Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-expreſſions are to be taken in the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>THat practiſe which hath a Goſpel-promiſe annexed to it, is undoubtedly warrantable. But the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome men who are not ordained Officers, hath a Goſpel-promiſe annexed to it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The preaching of ſome who are not ordained Officers, is undoubtedly warrantable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undenyable; for the Lord will not countenance any ſinful practice with his promiſe. That which hath a promiſe annexed to it, a man may act in faith therein; and ſo the practiſe muſt needs be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29. <hi>For unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>—</p>

1. Here is a promiſe, <hi>He that hath,</hi> i. e. if he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, exerciſeth, and improveth what gifts he hath, <hi>to him [ſhall be given.—] i. e.</hi> he ſhall increaſe his gifts, his labors ſhall be followed with a Divine bleſſing, he ſhall be abundantly bleſſed. The talent is taken away from that ſervant that hid it, that did not improve it; and it is given to him who had uſed his Talents, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. And Chriſt addeth this as an incouragement to an improvement of all Talents received, <hi>[for unto him that hath.—]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here are the perſons who ſhare in this promiſe, not Officers onely, but <hi>every man that hath,</hi> i. e. that improveth what he hath. Whatſoever gifts or Talents a man hath, here is a promiſe annexed to the laying of them forth for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We reſtrain not theſe gifts to preaching gifts; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to us, that theſe are included; neither doe we ſay, that every Chriſtian ought publickly to preach; many have not the Talent of preaching gifts. But whatſeover Talents any man who is a profeſſed Servant of Jeſus Chriſt hath (as verſ. 14.—<hi>Who called his own ſervants)</hi> he falleth under this promiſe in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, that <hi>to him ſhall be given.</hi>—He that hath private gifts, if he uſeth them, <hi>to him ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> he that hath publick gifts, if he uſeth them, to him ſhall be given.</p>
               <p>Now, none can deny that many un-ordained men have preaching gifts, <hi>i. e.</hi> gifts that render them apt to teach; for a knowledge of their having ſuch gifts, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required unto ordination. And here is a promiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto the uſe of any Talents, that any profeſſed ſervant of Chriſt hath; and therefore they that have preaching gifts, whether they be ordained or not, do fall under this promiſe in the uſe of their gifts.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>There is no great truſt to Arguments for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120096:45"/>
poſitive truths from parabolical expreſſions: what Talents are there meant, is not expreſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Parables are proofs of ſome poſitive truths, elſe of what uſe are they? To ſtrain parables beyond the ſcope of Chriſt in them, is unſafe. But that by Talents are meant gifts; by trading, a uſing or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thoſe gifts by Servants, not onely Officers, but viſible Saints, profeſſing ſubjection unto Chriſt as their Maſter, &amp;c. it is not to be denyed with any colour of reaſon. So that Arguments drawn from the parable this way, would be ſtrong.</p>
               <p>2. Our Argument is not from the parable, but from a general rule that hath a promiſe included in it. Indeed it is applyed to the parable, as a reaſon of that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. but alſo it is applyed unto other things, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 24, 25. <hi>Take heed what you hear,—and unto you that hear, ſhall more be given: for he that hath, to him ſhall be given.</hi>—If they improve Goſpel-opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, if they keep the word themſelves which they hear, and meaſure out or communicate unto others what they have heard, they ſhall not miſs of their reward, more ſhall be given them. So that it is no parabolical-argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, but from a clear rule, that ſaith, whatſoever gifts the Lord hath beſtowed upon his ſervants in the Church, they are in a way to enjoy the promiſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, if they be in the improvement of them.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>This will prove that women may preach too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is denyed; becauſe women are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is ſayd, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>All the People that came out</hi> (i. e. out of Egypt) <hi>were circumciſed;</hi> will any conclude, therefore women were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? <hi>[All]</hi> includeth women in that caſe, as much as [all that have gifts or Talents] doe include women in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>But may it not be meant of Miniſterial
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120096:45"/>
Talent, and a called Ministry,</hi> ver. 14, 15. <hi>his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the parable of the Talents might be underſtood of them, yet this general rule and promiſe cannot be reſtrained to them, becauſe it is applyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to hearers, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 24, 25. <hi>Unto you that hear, ſhall be given. For</hi>—and becauſe the rule is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</p>
               <p>2. Neither can the parable be reſtrained to them, ſeeing others beſides Officers are in the Kingdome of Heaven, are ſervants, have their Lords goods, and muſt give an account.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. But they muſt do it orderly; firſt, be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then preach: and is there no way of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts, but in publick preaching? he that that hath them, muſt improve them in his Sphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is granted that he muſt be ordained when he undertaketh to be an Officer; but Election or a Call from a Church muſt precede that: let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that a man may have ordination to Office-work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath Election from a Church; or that he may ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the exerciſe of his gifts, until he hath ſuch a Call from a Church. It is poſſible that a man may have gifts, which render him apt to teach, divers Yeares before any Church may elect him to Office: but he would be in danger of loſing the benefit of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>[to him that hath, ſhall be given,]</hi> and of falling under that dreadful threatning, <hi>[from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath.]</hi> if all this time he ſhould not exerciſe his gifts.</p>
               <p>2. It belongeth to his Calling, who hath gifts fit for publick uſe, to improve them publickly: the very end of the Lords affording ſuch gifts, is, That they might be laid forth in ſuch a way. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</hi> If one ordained to Office-work ſhould uſe his gifts in a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120096:46"/>
private, and not in publick, he would be called to an account for not uſing or improving his gifts, and not barely becauſe being ordained he did not uſe them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. Men ſhall not be called to an account barely for the not uſing gifts, but for the not uſing them in that way wherein they might moſt have promoted the Lords glory, and the publick good.</p>

That <hi>Apollos</hi> had Divine allowance, in this his preaching: the Holy Ghoſt would never have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to give him ſuch high Commendations for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mighty in the Scriptures, <hi>v.</hi> 24. for his knowledge, <hi>v.</hi> 25. inſtructed in the way of the Lord, for his Zeal, and this as an occaſion of, or a leading thing to, his preaching, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>being fervent in Spirit, he ſpake and taught</hi>—if the Lord had not approved of his preaching. And the mentioning ſo many matters of his praiſe to uſher in a narration of his preaching, without limiting any word of diſpraiſe for that, doth ſtrongly intimate Divine approbation in his preaching. Yea, his preaching it ſelf is declared with Commendation.</p>
               <p>He is ſaid to preach:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Diligently, not negligently: <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>He ſpake and taught diligently.</hi>—</p>
               <p n="2">2. Boldly, not with a carnal fearfulneſs. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>He began to ſpeak [boldly—]</hi> the ſame, as a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is given unto <hi>Paul,</hi> when the Diſciples were afraid of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 27, 28. <hi>But</hi> Barnabas <hi>took him, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120096:47"/>
brought him to the Apoſtles, and declared unto them—how he had [preached boldly] at Damaſcus, in the Name of Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Succeſsfully, or prevailingly, <hi>v.</hi> 28.—<hi>He migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily convinced the Jews</hi>—his labours were ſeconded with a Divine bleſſing.</p>
               <p>All theſe Commendations of his preaching, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſpeak forth his having Divine approbation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And this is enough to anſwer that Objection which ſome bring, <hi>viz.</hi> That this is but an inſtance of the liberty given by the Jews, or taken, where as yet there was no Church in being; and the liberty given in the Jewiſh Synagogues, is no more a preſident for Chriſtian Churches, then their exerciſe of power.—</p>
               <p>We ſay, That if onely the Jews had given ſuch a liberty, that would not have been enough to make it a preſident for us; but Chriſts approbation in Goſpel-days of ſuch a practiſe as the Jews gave liberty for, is enough to ſpeak the warrantableneſs of ſuch a practiſe, and to make it a preſident unto us.</p>
               <p>We do not urge the lawfulneſs of gifted mens preaching, becauſe the Jews gave ſuch a liberty to <hi>Apollos,</hi> but becauſe with Divine allowance <hi>Apollos</hi> took the liberty to preach.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>Apollos</hi> was not an ordained Officer; and that we prove, thus:</p>
               <p>He that knew onely the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn,</hi> was not under the Ordination to Office-work, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt. But <hi>Apollos</hi> knew onely the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>Iohn, Act.</hi> 18. 25.—<hi>He ſpake and taught dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the things of the Lord, [knowing onely the baptiſme of Iohn.] Ergo, Apollos</hi> was not under the Ordination to Office-work, which was inſtituted by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Minor is undeniable, being the very words of the Text.</p>
               <p>The Major, That he that knew onely the baptiſm
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:120096:47"/>
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> was not under the Ordination to Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, which was inſtituted by Chriſt, we prove, thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the inſtituting of Ordination was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn:</hi> the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake nothing of Ordination of Officers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that knew onely the baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> could know nothing of that Ordination; eſpecially ſeeing in order of time, the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was preceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to the inſtitution of Ordination of Officers. He that knew onely the baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> which was Antecedent to the inſtituting of Ordination, he did not know that Ordination which was Subſequent to that baptiſme.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Apollos</hi> knew onely the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> which was Antecedent to the inſtituting of Ordination. <hi>Ergo, Apollos</hi> did not know that Ordination which was Subſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to that baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the importance of the expreſſion doth deny his being ordained: for the Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from the baptiſme of Chriſt, <hi>Act 19. v. 3. Unto what then were ye baptiſed? and they ſaid, Unto Johns baptiſm.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Then ſaid Paul, John verily baptiſed with the baptiſm of repentance, ſaying unto the people, that they ſhould believe on him which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> v. 5. <hi>When they heard this, they were baptiſed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Whence we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 1. That the baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Chriſt, are they which in Scripture-phraſe are diſtinguiſhed each from other, as appeareth by comparing <hi>v.</hi> 3. with <hi>v.</hi> 5. and therefore to ſay, That <hi>Apollos</hi> did know onely the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> is to ſay, That he did not know the baptiſme of Chriſt; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not know Ordination, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained onely to the baptiſme of Chriſt, and not to that of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:120096:48"/>
2. That the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> doth comprehend the Doctrine and Miniſtry of <hi>John,</hi> as well as the outward ſigne of water, <hi>v.</hi> 4. The baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> did teach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and faith in Chriſt: it declared that Jeſus of Nazareth was the Chriſt, the Meſſias, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be expected, and [that he ſhould come after] <hi>i e.</hi> openly to ſhew, manifeſt and reveale himſelf to be the Redeemer of the world.</p>
               <p>The baptiſme of Chriſt teacheth, That Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready revealed; and in his death and reſurrection our Salvation is made perfect.</p>
               <p>So that [to know onely the baptiſme of <hi>John,]</hi> is to know Jeſus of Nazareth to be the Meſſias, and to have repentance and faith in him, as afterward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale himſelf; but to be without a knowledge of Chriſt, as already revealed in his death, reſurrection, and in thoſe clear doctrines of the Goſpel, and Miracles for the confirmation of thoſe doctrines, which are given forth by the Apoſtles as fruits of the Aſcention of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore he that knew onely the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of <hi>John,</hi> could not know the Ordination which was inſtituted by Chriſt, becauſe the inſtitution of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is found amongſt thoſe doctrines which belong to the baptiſm of Chriſt and was not given forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea, the knowledge of Ordination preſuppoſeth a knowledge of many other doctrines of the Goſpel, as concerning Chriſts eſtabliſhing Church-Order for his Worſhip, and the profeſſion of his Name: and that he hath inſtituted ſuch Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which none by the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> onely could reach unto. Therefore there being this defect in <hi>Apollos</hi> knowledge, hence he was not an ordained Officer; for then he had known more then the baptiſme of <hi>John:</hi> yea, he had known the baptiſme of Chriſt; which to aſſert, were directly to croſs the words of the Text, which declare, that he knew onely the baptiſme of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:120096:48"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But was not <hi>Apollos</hi> an extraordinary Officer, or had he not an extraordinary Call to preach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let him prove it, that will aſſert it. The Text ſpeaketh not of any thing extraordinary; a man may be eloquent without extraordinary gifts, and mighty in the Scriptures: ordinary Officers are to hold faſt the faithful Word; and to be able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gainſayers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. and this is to be mighty in the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 28. <hi>He mightily convinced the Jews</hi>—and ordinary Saints are commanded to be fervent in Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. Therefore theſe will not prove an extraordinary Call.</p>
               <p>2. His being ſo uninſtructed in the way of the Lord, as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> excelled him in knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>v.</hi> 26. ſtrongly argueth his not being extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifted.</p>
               <p>3. The people at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he preached, <hi>v.</hi> 24. 25. were, after his departure from them, ignorant of thoſe extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.—We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt. If <hi>Apollos</hi> (who before preached to them) had been indued with thoſe extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſurely they ſhould have heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But how will it be proved that <hi>Apollos</hi> being one of <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, had no commiſſion from <hi>John</hi> to preach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let thoſe that can, prove that he had ſuch a commiſſion from <hi>John;</hi> the Goſpel is ſilent about it: we read that he was gifted, <hi>v. 24. Might in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>—and that he had a zealous diſpoſition to exerciſe thoſe gifts, and that put him upon preaching, <hi>v. 25. Being fervent in Spirit, he ſpake and taught.</hi>—This ſeemeth to hold out, that perſons really gifted, being
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:120096:49"/>
fervent in ſpirit, may ſpeak and teach, where opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is offered.</p>
               <p>2. We cannot find that <hi>John</hi> gave commiſſion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Diſciples to preach: the Objection is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Suppoſition; and this being denyed, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together groundleſs: we ask, how it will be proved that <hi>John</hi> gave a commiſſion to any to preach? if it cannot be proved that he did, the Objection is vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. <hi>Apollos</hi> abilities were eminent; he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent, and mighty in the Scriptures—and he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where there was no Church; and therefore this will not warrant their preaching, who have not ſuch gifts, in places where Chriſt is known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It matters not how eminent his gifts were: the Queſtion is not, whether perſons not eminently gifted, may preach? but the Queſtion is, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo eminently gifted, as (according to Goſpel-Rules) Preachers ought to be, may exerciſe thoſe gifts in publick Aſſemblies, though they be not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Office-work? If they will grant, that men of like abilities with <hi>Apollo,</hi> may preach without Ordination; then they cannot with any colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deny a like liberty to others to preach without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, if their gifts be ſo eminent, as (according to Goſpel-Rules) Preachers ought to be, though far inferiour to <hi>Apollos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Objection ſuppoſeth, that gifted men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination, may preach, where no Church is; we wiſh that liberty were not denyed them. But, let it be proved, that it is more unwarrantable to preach where a Church is, then where no Church is.</p>
               <p>3. If it be ſaid, that becauſe there was no Church, therefore Ordination could not be had, and ſo he might lawfully preach without it, which otherwiſe he might not have done, if there had been a Church to give
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:120096:49"/>
Ordination; We anſwer, Though Ordination could not be had there, if there were no Church, yet it might have been had elſe-where, at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. <hi>Apollos</hi> ſeems to be more then a gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he is ranked with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. he is called a Miniſter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That was afterward; when he was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> he might be an Officer for ought we know, and be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; but his preaching at <hi>Epheſus, Act.</hi> 18. 24, 25. was before his going to <hi>Corinth, v.</hi> 27. when he was diſpoſed to paſs into <hi>Achaia,</hi> the Brethren wrote, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the Diſciples to receive him,—<hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>And it came to paſs, that while Apollos was at Corinth,</hi>—This intimateth that <hi>Apollos</hi> going to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was in <hi>Achaia,</hi> was after his preaching at <hi>Epheſus:</hi> his being an Officer afterward at <hi>Corinth,</hi> doth no more prove that he was an Officer before at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> then his knowing the baptiſm of Chriſt at <hi>Corinth,</hi> doth prove his knowing of it at his firſt coming to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he is ſaid to know onely the baptiſme of <hi>John.</hi> And, thoſe who are now but gifted Brethren, may afterwards become Officers.</p>
               <p>2. From the preaching of the ſcattered Saints, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. we infer the lawfulneſs of gifted mens preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though not ordained.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Act</hi> 8. 1.—<hi>And at that time there was a great perſecution againſt the Church which was at Jeruſalem; and they were all ſcattered abroad thorow out the regions of Judea, and Samaria, except the Apoſtles</hi>—v. 3. <hi>As for Saul, he made havock of the Church, entring into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houſe, and haling men and women, committed them to priſon.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Therefore they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching the Word.</hi> Act. 1. 1. <hi>v</hi> 19, 20, 21. <hi>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</hi>—From hence we obſerve:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:120096:50"/>
1. That theſe ſcattered Saints preached publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 4. they <hi>went every where preaching the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That they had Divine allowance in this their preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>The hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed</hi>—the Lord eminently owned their labours with his bleſſing; which argues his approbation of them in their work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That theſe ſcattered Saints who preached, were (many of them at leaſt) unordained. This may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 4. The perſons who preached, are ſaid to be the ſcattered Saints, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>They that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching</hi>—and who were ſcattered, is declared <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>There was a great perſecution againſt the Church which was at Jeruſalem, and they were all ſcattered abroad.</hi>—We argue thus:</p>
               <p>Thoſe who were ſcattered abroad upon the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they preached the word with Divine allowance. But many men un-ordained were ſcattered abroad upon the perſecution. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Many men un-ordained did preach the word with Divine allowance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 4. The ſcattering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad is the very Character which the Holy-Ghoſt doth ſet out theſe preachers by, neither is it ſaid, [ſome] of thoſe that were ſcattered, but <hi>[they that were ſcattered.—]</hi> therefore very very many, a very great, if not the greateſt part of thoſe who were ſcattered, they preached; otherwiſe, if but a few of them had preached, it had been improper to ſet out who were preachers by the ſcattering. Thoſe that had not abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties could not doe it; but all that were ſcattered who had gifts, did it, elſe the phraſe were improper.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. If it was the Church at Jeruſalem that was ſcattered abroad upon the perſecution, then many men un-ordained were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:120096:50"/>
ſcattered abroad; for ſurely none will ſay that the Church was ordained; Church, according to the uſual acceptation of it, muſt imply the generality of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and ſurely our Brethren will not ſay, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Church-Members were ordained, or were Officers. But it was the Church at Jeruſalem that was ſcattered abroad upon the perſecution. <hi>Ergo,</hi> many men un-ordained were ſcattered abroad.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>There was a great perſecution againſt [the Church] which was at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and [they] were [all] ſcattered abroad.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Our Brethren <hi>(Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 110.) aſſert, That they were men in Office who were ſcattered, and that theſe <hi>all</hi> were all the Church-Officers.</p>
               <p>The Text ſaith, The perſecution was againſt the Church; they ſay it was onely againſt the Officers of the Church. The Text ſaith, <hi>[all] were ſcattered.</hi>—They ſay, only the Officers, who were few in compariſon of the Church, were ſcattered. We confeſs we cannot but wonder at ſuch interpretations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The very Grammatical conſtruction will forbid its being reſtrained to Officers, or their being chiefly intended. For ask the Queſtion, <hi>Who were all ſcattered abroad?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, <hi>[The Church which was at Jeruſalem?]</hi> there are no other perſons ſpoken of, for it to have reference unto: Officers were not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before Church was; and therefore it was the Church, and not Officers onely, that were ſcattered, and did Preach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles, who were the chiefeſt Officers, were not ſcattered, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.—<hi>They were all ſcattered—except the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the perſecution &amp; ſcattering had been of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers onely, then the ſcattering would have been rather of the Apoſtles, who were the chiefeſt Officers, then of inferior Officers. Therefore it's probable their ſpite
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120096:51"/>
was rather againſt Church-order, and their deſign ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break the Church, then to ſcatter Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. All the Beleevers were not ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>That Saul made</hi>

                  <hi>havock of the Church, entring into every houſe, and women, committed them to priſon.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 22. There is expreſs mention made of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> notwithſtanding the perſecution. Had all the Beleevers been ſcattered, what ſhould the Apoſtles have done at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That by Church is not meant Officers onely, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. is cleared, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and that the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was againſt more then Officers; for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuffered by it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Pauls</hi> making havock of the Church, might be one means of the total ſcattering of it: it may be a narration how the Church came to be ſcattered, rather then of what followed its ſcattering. It may be a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Sauls</hi> carriage in this perſecution, rather then after it. It is not ſaid that all were ſcattered, and then <hi>Saul</hi> made havock of it; his making havock of it, might be that which fully ſcattered it: and hence the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is mentioned again, after his making havock of it, <hi>ver. 4. Therefore they that were ſcattered.</hi>—</p>
               <p>3. All the Beleevers might be ſcattered, and yet <hi>Saul</hi> might be ſaid to make havock of the Church, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into every houſe,</hi>—after ſcattering. Some of that <hi>all</hi> might be ſcattered in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo <hi>Saul</hi> might be ſaid to make havock of the Church, in haling our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Members of the Church, out of thoſe private houſes into which they were ſcattered, and putting them in priſon. The Church might be ſaid to be ſcattered, when deprived of liberty to hold up Church-meetings, though the Members had not been driven out of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> The Text doth not ſay that they were all dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by this ſcattering, though it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120096:51"/>
other places into which they were ſcattered. The Church might be ſcattered thorowout thoſe places mentioned, and in Jeruſalem too, and <hi>Saul</hi> might make havock of it at Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>4. Whereas they ſay, there is expreſs mention made of a Church at Jeruſalem, notwithſtanding the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 22. We anſwer, This doth not hinder but that all the beleevers might be ſcattered; but onely denyeth that the ſcattering was perpetual. Before the diſperſion, we read onely of a Church at Jeruſalem; but before the time mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 22. we read of Churches in Judea: <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. new Churches were planted in the time between; and therefore it is eaſie to conceive, that there was ſpace enough for ſo many of the ſcattered Saints to return (the perſecution ceaſing) as might walk as a Church at Jeruſalem again. And for this end might the Apoſtles tarry ſtill at Jeruſalem, to put the Church in order again, when the heat of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſhould be over; and to preach for the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, ſo ſoon as liberty ſhould be offered. And <hi>Sauls</hi> entring into every houſe, and <hi>haling men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to priſon,</hi> ver. 3. doth argue, that not the Officers onely, but the Church was now ſcattered; why elſe ſhould he mention women, or make ſuch a narrow ſearch in every houſe for them, if Church-meetings had ſtill continued, where he might have taken many together? Therefore the beginning of the ſcattering ſeemeth to be by depriving of liberty for publick Church-meetings; the full ſcattering, by haling out of private houſes.—</p>

               <p>And if we take <hi>[all]</hi> in this ſenſe, it ariſeth but to thus much: <hi>[All] were ſcattered abroad,</hi> i. e. very many were ſcattered, ſo as there remained very few, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Apoſtles.</p>

               <p>2. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Ordination was to the Office-work of a Deacon, not of a Preacher, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. that Office and Ordination could not authorize him to preach.

It is ſaid there, there was a Church ſetled at <hi>Antioch;</hi> which could not be, unleſs they were firſt baptiſed: but there were none in <hi>Antioch</hi> to baptiſe them, if they of the diſperſion did not; for <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Agabus,</hi> and other Prophets, came not to <hi>Antioch</hi> till the Church was founded, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. and this Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be founded by the ſcattered Brethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 19.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We cannot find that it is ſaid, there was a Church ſetled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> before <hi>Barnabas</hi> had been there; much leſs do we finde it expreſly ſaid, that this Church was founded by the ſcattered Brethren: <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 26. ſaith, <hi>that a whole year they</hi> (i. e. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul, v.</hi> 25, 26.) <hi>aſſembled themſelves with the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:120096:54"/>
Church,</hi>—which clearly ſheweth that then there was a Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and alſo that <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> (Church-Officers) were there: but <hi>Barnabas</hi> had been at <hi>Antioch</hi> before this, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>They ſent forth Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, that he ſhould go as far as</hi> Antioch. <hi>Who when he came, and had ſeen the grace of God, was glad</hi>—and after this he departed to ſeek <hi>Saul, v.</hi> 25. But when the Church was ſetled, whether before <hi>Barnabas</hi> came, or after, we finde not, nor by whoſe hands. The place alledged to prove expreſly that it was founded by the ſcattered Brethren, is falſly quoted by the Printer, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 19. for it ſpeaketh nothing about the buſineſs. If they mean <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 21. It is ſaid there, that the Hand of the Lord was with the ſcattered Saints, and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. But this is far from ſpeaking expreſly, that a Church was founded by them.</p>
               <p>Surely by their believing they were not founded Church; or if they were, this will deſtroy our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Objection altogether: for then either they firſt baptized them before they did believe, and that will croſs Goſpel-order, which pre-requireth believing in thoſe that are <hi>Adulti</hi> unto baptiſme, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 36, 37. Or elſe they were firſt a Church by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and afterward were baptiſed: and then the Objection falleth; for then there could be a Church ſetled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> though they were not firſt baptiſed; and they of the diſperſion might ſettle a Church, and yet might not baptiſe. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> might do that afterward.</p>
               <p>2. We apprehend there might be a Church ſetled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> before they were baptized: if baptiſme be to be performed onely by men in Office, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and men be Officers onely to a Church, as is proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then they muſt firſt become a Church, before they can orderly be baptiſed. And then they might
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120096:54"/>
be a Church, and yet not be baptiſed until <hi>Barnabas</hi> came to them.</p>
               <p>3. If a Church could not be ſetled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> til firſt they were baptized; yet in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity where no Officers could be had, why might not the ſcattered Chriſtians baptize thoſe that were converted, though no Officers, as well as by our Brethrens firſt Anſwer to <hi>Act.</hi> 8. they might preach in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity? yet we aſſert not, that men out of Office may baptize.</p>

               <p>2. It is improbable that they ſhould have ſuch a miſſion, in regard the perſecution occaſioned their travels, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 3, 4. <hi>Saul made havock of the Church—[therefore] they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word.</hi> [Therefore] becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted the Church: it is not ſaid therefore they preached, as if they might not lawfully have preached, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution had not been; but becauſe they could not enjoy peace and liberty at Jeruſalem, therefore they went every where, and in their travels they were not idle, but exerciſed in preaching the word.</p>
               <p>Then, 1. The perſecution, not the Apoſtles miſſion, occaſioned their travels: had they received

It is not recorded that theſe did preach while they were at Jeruſalem in a ſetled Church, but when they were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; it cannot warrant preaching by perſons uncalled, where Churches and Miniſters are, or may eaſily be had. This is no better Argument, then if one ſhould argue—Becauſe when there was no King in Iſrael, every one did as it ſeemed good in his own eyes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Subjects at any time may do ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is true, that a man may do ſome things, (neceſſity driving to it) that at other times would be unlawful, where there is no ſuch neceſſity. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though perſecution neceſſitated theſe Diſciples to travel, yet that laid no neceſſity upon them to preach; and therefore neceſſity can be no plea in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is queſtionable whether neceſſity, or an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:120096:56"/>
caſe, can make that which which is in it ſelf unlawful, become lawful: if a man doth ſwear falſly, becauſe elſe he ſhall ſuffer, he ſinneth in it; as <hi>Peter</hi> did, when to avoid ſuffering, he with oaths denyed Chriſt. But that which is not in it ſelf unlawful, but onely at this time, or in this or that caſe, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in time of perſecution. If it were in it ſelf unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preach without Ordination, then it were to be queſtioned, whether in a time of perſecution it could be lawful? If when there was no King, the people did what was right in their own eyes, and not what the Law of God required, they ſinned in it, and they had no Divine allowance therein; but theſe had a Divine allowance to preach, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Queſtion is, when is there ſuch a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity? when is the caſe ſo extraordinary, as a man may lawfully preach without Ordination, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould ſin in preaching without it? Surely when Ordination can be attained in Gods way, thoſe who are required to ſubmit unto it, may not lawfully be without it, upon any pretence of neceſſity, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſe. And if Ordination cannot be had in Gods way, or according to his will and appointment, then the caſe is extraordinary, and neceſſity may be pleaded for being without it, as well as if it could not be had at all: for a man ſinneth who taketh up an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt out of Chriſts Way, or not as he hath appointed; and it were to be under a neceſſity of ſinning, to be obliged to do any thing out of Chriſts Way.</p>
               <p>Now we find no rule for Ordination to Office-work without Election from a Church, as antecedaneous thereunto; and it were to go out of Chriſts Way, and to act not according to his Will and appointment, to be ordained to Office-work before ſuch a Call from a Church: and therefore all gifted men lie under ſuch a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:120096:56"/>
caſe of neceſſity, or it is an extraordinary caſe, until ſome Church of Chriſt hath given them ſuch a Call; and ſo they may preach until then without Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. They that preach in ſuch an extraordinary caſe, either they are Officers, or no Officers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If they be no Officers: then preaching is not an act peculiar to Office; then there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween preaching by Office; and preaching by Gift; then there is a notion beſides Office, under which men may warrantably preach; and this will be applicable to gifted men: as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſaith, it is a contradiction, that the formal act ſhould be before the form be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. That which one who is no Officer may do, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an act of Office in it ſelf, but as performed in this or that manner.</p>
               <p>Let not gifted brethren, then, be charged with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Office of the Miniſtery, or intruding into the Office, becauſe they preach: if they do no more then perſons who are no Officers may do, then there is no uſurpation of the Office in doing of it. That which can be done in any caſe lawfully, by a perſon that is no Officer, cannot without contradiction be ſaid to be an act peculiar to Office, or an act of Office in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Preaching it ſelf then is not an act of Office; but preaching in ſuch a manner, or under ſuch a relation. And let not gifted brethren be denyed liberty to preach, but onely to preach Office-wiſe; ſeeing Preaching may be by a perſon not in Office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If thoſe that preach in ſuch extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſes be Officers, then</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ordination is not eſſential to Office. Office, nor any other thing, can ſubſiſt or be, without its eſſentials: if eſſentials, Matter and Form, be not found, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum</hi> is denyed to have a being. If Office may be preſerved in being, where Ordination is not, then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:120096:57"/>
cannot be eſſential to Office, much leſs be the formal cauſe of it. As well may there be a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reaſonable ſoul, as Office without Ordination, if Ordination be the formal cauſe of Office. Take away the eſſence of Office, and the formal cauſe, or that which is conſtitutive thereof, and there can be no Officer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then another Miſſion muſt be found out beſides Ordination; or elſe men may preach who are not ſent, and men may believe without hearing a Preacher ſent: and then that Rule is not univerſal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then if men baptize without Ordination, their acts may be valid, according to their own arguing: for ſay they,</p>
               <p>Thoſe that may preach, may baptize, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. And (by the way) why may not Baptiſm be valid, when performed by perſons whoſe Ordination by the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it is a nullity, as well as when by perſons who are altogether without Ordination?</p>

               <p>All that are Prophets, may publikely preach.</p>
               <p>But ſome men who are not ordained Officers, are Prophets:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some men who are not ordained Officers, may publikely preach.</p>
               <p>The Major, That all that are Prophets may publikely preach, is proved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 29. <hi>Let the prophets ſpeak</hi>—verſ. 31. <hi>For ye may [all propheſie] one by one</hi>—Here is an univerſal liberty given to all the Prophets to exerciſe their gifts publikely in a ſetled Church: verſ. 23. <hi>If therefore the whole church be come together into ſome place</hi>—verſ. 24. <hi>if all propheſie</hi>—This propheſying therefore was publikely, in a Church-meeting: and not onely ſome, but all the Prophets have a liberty of propheſying granted to them, verſ. 31. We do not ſay, that [all] hath reference to every member of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> as if all the people of the Church might prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:120096:57"/>
whether they had the gift or no: we grant the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not extend ſo far; and therefore many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed by our Brethren, to prove that [all] doth not include every member in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> do not touch us. That all the Prophets in that Church had the liberty of propheſying granted to them, is as much as we aſſert: and this our Brethren cannot deny.</p>
               <p>The Minor, That ſome men who are not ordained Officers are Prophets, we prove thus:</p>
               <p>All that have the gift of Prophecie, are Prophets.</p>
               <p>But ſome men who are not ordained Officers have the gift of Prophecie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some men who are not ordained Officers are Prophets.</p>
               <p>The Major, That all who have the gift of Prophecie are Prophets, is evident,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From their denomination: the name Prophet is properly applicable unto all that have a gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: yea, the reaſon of that name muſt be, either onely becauſe they do actually propheſie; and that cannot be, becauſe they muſt be Prophets before they can warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably do that; or becauſe they have a gift to propheſie. How can they be denyed the name of Prophets, who enjoy that gift which giveth the denomination?</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Apoſtles calling propheſie a gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Though I have [the gift of propheſie,—]</hi> and Rom. 12. 6. <hi>Having then gifts, differing—whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, let us propheſie.</hi> Thoſe that have the gift of propheſie, are commanded here to propheſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From their being no Church-Officers, who are by the Apoſtles called prophets, and are commanded to propheſie: that ſome of theſe prophets were no Church-Officers, we ſhall endeavour to prove by and by. And if they were not prophets by Office, then they muſt be prophets who have the gift of propheſie. Either an Office, or a Gift, muſt give the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:120096:58"/>
If the gift be enough to give the denomination, then all that have the gift of propheſie, are prophets. To clear the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome men who are not ordained Officers, have the gift of propheſie, There are three things neceſſary to be proved:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That propheſie is a Gift, not an Office.</item>
                  <item>2. That ſome men have the gift of propheſie; or that propheſying is a gift ſtill continuing.</item>
                  <item>3. That ſome men who are not ordained Officers, have that gift of propheſie.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This laſt poſition is proved thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is no Scripture-warrant for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining prophets: and without a Scripture-warrant, they may not be ordained. Let any be produced.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they cannot warrantably be ordained Prophets, until they be diſcerned to have the gift of propheſie: they muſt have the gift firſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome men not ordained have the gift of propheſie, if it be a continuing gift.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe there are ſome who have the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, who are no officers, as will appear in what followeth; and Ordination (according to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Judgment) is the eſſential conſtitutive thing of an Officer. He that is ordained (ſay they) is an Officer. Many of theſe Prophets are no Officers, and therefore not ordained.</p>
               <p>For we ſuppoſe they will not ſay, that a man may be lawfully ordained, and yet be no Church-Officer. Our greateſt difficulty therefore is, to prove the former Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. That the propheſying ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is a Gift, not an Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Becauſe all who have the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie are Prophets. Our two firſt Arguments before given, prove this; we ſhall not here repeat them. The Conſequence is clear; becauſe all who have the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:120096:58"/>
gift of Propheſie, are not Officers; they muſt firſt have the gift, before they can be made Prophets by Office. If they be Prophets ſo ſoon as they have the gift, then they are Prophets who are no Officers: for if there had been ſuch an Office, the gift muſt have been before the Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. That which ought in duty, and might warrantably in faith, be coveted by every man who was a Member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that was a gift onely, not an Office. But the propheſying ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was ſuch as ought in duty, and might war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably in faith be coveted by every man who was a Member of the Church at <hi>Corinth. Ergo,</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was a gift onely, not an Office.</p>
               <p>The Major we prove thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which the Lord had no where promiſed to accompliſh, that could not in duty, nor warrantably in faith be coveted; for it is a humane faith that hath not a Divine promiſe to bottom upon. But the Lord had no where promiſed to make every man who was a Member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> (or any other Church) a Church-Officer. Let them ſhew a promiſe of it, that will aſſert it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Every man who was a Member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> could not in duty, nor warrantably in faith covet to be a Church-Officer. <hi>Ergo,</hi> That which ought in duty, and might warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in faith be coveted by every man who was a Member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that was a Gift onely, not an Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which was impoſſible to be attained, that could not in duty, nor warrantably in faith be coveted. It's in vain to covet that which can never be had, or which is unattainable. But for every man who was a Member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to covet to become an Officer, had been to covet that which was impoſſible
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:120096:59"/>
to be attained. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? v.</hi> 19, 29, 30. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It could not in duty, nor warrantably in faith be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſay that the Prophets were extraordinary Officers, as they muſt be, if they were Officers at all, elſe being ordinary Officers, they muſt be ſtill continuing, and ſo there is ſtill another Order of preaching Officers in the Church, beſides and diſtinct from Paſtors and Teachers, which they will not aſſert, is more abſurd.</p>
               <p>If they were extraordinary Officers, that maketh the caſe worſe. Can it be imagined, that every man who was a member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> ought in duty, and might warrantably in faith covet to be an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officer, when it doth not appear that he might covet the ordinary Office of a Paſtor or Teacher?</p>
               <p>Doth it not ſound harſh, to ſay, that every man in a Church ought to covet to be an Officer in the Church? Can our Brethren exhort all the men that walk with them in Ordinances, to covet that they may be Paſtors or Teachers? or do they unfeignedly deſire it? If they did, ſurely they would not lay ſo much diſcouragement before gifted men, to hinder their preaching. And can they imagine that the Apoſtle ſhould exhort the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to covet to be extraordinary Officers, when themſelves cannot exhort the generality of Chriſtians to covet to be ordinary Officers?</p>
               <p>Thus we have proved the Major of our ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the evincing that the propheſying ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 is a Gift onely, not an Office.</p>
               <p>The Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> That the propheſying ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was ſuch as ought in duty, and might warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in faith be coveted by every man who was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> we prove from verſ. 1, 5, 39. There is a command for it, verſ. 1. <hi>Follow after cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:120096:59"/>
and deſire ſpiritual gifts, but rather that ye may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>I would that ye all ſpake with tongues, but rather that ye propheſied.</hi>—Here he wiſheth, that not ſome onely, but [all] propheſied: the gift of prophecie then may lawfully be wiſhed to all men that are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Church: and he addeth a reaſon of his wiſh; <hi>[for greater is he that propheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the Church may receive edifying]</hi> becauſe prophecie tendeth more to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, then ſpeaking with tongues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interpretation. <hi>v. 39. Wherefore brethren, covet to propheſie.</hi>—Here is an exhortation left in general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whereby he layeth it upon them as a duty; and therefore it was that which any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them might warrantably in faith, covet to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto. All had not attained to it; but every man might covet to propheſie. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It was no Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Prophets are enumerated amongſt Officers of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29. <hi>God hath ſet in his Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers,—Epheſ.</hi> 4 11, 12. Yea they are ſet next Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Mr. col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> above Evangeliſts, and Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—Apoſtles and Teachers were Officers ſet by God in his Church, ſo alſo were <note place="margin">Jus Divin.</note> the Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The placing of Prophets before Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Paſtors and Teachers, cannot prove them to be in dignity above Paſtors or Teachers.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren themſelves uſe theſe words; Priority of Order is no infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:120096:60"/>
And in another place <hi>(Ib. p.</hi> 147.) they ſay, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Paſtor is put before the Teacher, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. ſometimes the Teacher before the Paſtor, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>We may adde further, that according to their own interpretation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Min. page</hi> 97.</note> word of wiſdome denotes the Paſtors work, the word of knowledge the Teachers work; and yet propheſie is put after theſe, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>To another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie</hi>—And if any will build a concluſion upon the order of words, which order will they ſtick to? <hi>v.</hi> 8, 10. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are put after Paſtors and Teachers, &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. Prophets are ſet before Teachers.</p>
               <p>2. The enumerating of Prophets amongſt Officers of the Church, is not ſufficient to evidence that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were Officers: for though ſome Officers be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet we conceive that all which are named are not Officers; for here are eight enumerated, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>firſt Apoſtles, ſecond Prophets, third Teachers, fourth Miracles, fifth Gifts of healing, ſixth Helps, ſeventh Governments, eighth Diverſities of tongues;</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where there are others to be added, <hi>v.</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>ninth diſcerning of Spirits, tenth the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tongues, eleventh Evangeliſts.</hi> Can any conclude that there were eight, or eleven Officers in the Church in thoſe days? You may ſay that there were ſo many diſtinct Officers, becauſe ſo many are enumerated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Officers, as well as that Prophets are Officers, becauſe reckoned up together with Officers. Whereas ſome of thoſe enumerated are gifts, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 30, 31. and particularly propheſie is called a gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Though I have the gift of propheſie,</hi> Rom. 12. 6. Yea, diverſe of thoſe gifts mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. did meet in one Officer; the Apoſtles were Officers, yet they wrought Miracles, had the gift of tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. Nay, the gift of tongues is one Office, (if they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:120096:60"/>
be all Officers that be enumerated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of tongues)</hi> and this gift was granted unto ſome before they were baptiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 46, 47, 48. <hi>On the Gentiles alſo was poured out the gift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, for they heard them ſpeak with tongues, and magnifie God. Then anſwered Peter, Can any man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized</hi>—</p>
               <p>Here was the gift of tongues before baptiſme; and therefore according to our Brethrens principles, before Church-Memberſhip; and if they were not yet Church-Members, how could they be Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers? if they were not ſet in the Church, how could they be ſet as Officers in it? Yet if the enumerating of Prophets amongſt Officers, would prove them to be Church-Officers, then the enumerating of the gifts of tongues amongſt Officers in the very ſame verſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. would prove thoſe that had ſuch gifts to be Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers alſo.</p>
               <p>3. If Prophets muſt be Officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. thoſe places may be intended of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prophets, who did foretel of future events, as <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 27, 28. <hi>In thoſe days came Prophets from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem unto Antioch, and there ſtood up one of them, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Agabus, and ſignified by the Spirit, that there ſhould be a great dearth thorowout the world</hi> If ſuch Prophets be intended in thoſe forecited places, and be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers, yet this hinders not, but that the Prophets mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. may be onely by gift: eſpecially ſeeing the fourteenth Chapter is an entire Exhortation of it ſelf, and chiefly ſpent in holding forth Directions about propheſying, and that to the whole Church, without hinting any thing about foretelling things to come; which muſt be their main work as Prophets, if ſuch a ſort of Prophets were intended.</p>
               <p>

That which was in uſe by Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the primitive times, and no Goſpel-Rule can be ſhewn for the repeal or ceaſing of it; that muſt needs be ſtill continuing: If the Law which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the uſe of it be ſtill in force, or unrepealed, ſurely the uſe of it ought to be continued, for elſe the Law of Chriſt is broken, and ſin attendeth it. But propheſying was in uſe by Divine appointment in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, and no Goſpel-Rule can be ſhewn for the repeal or ceaſing of it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> propheſying muſt needs be ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>That propheſying was in uſe by Divine appointment in primitive times, it cannot be denyed; this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. almoſt thorowout, is purpoſely to reprove an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular uſe of propheſying, and to direct in the right uſe; and therefore, as Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> well obſerveth, the Apoſtle doth grant and eſtabliſh an uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Now let our Brethren ſhew any Goſpel-Rule to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that propheſying is now ceaſed, which we have proved was once in uſe by Divine appointment We ſhould not need produce a Rule to prove it is not ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is their work to prove that it is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Yet we ſhall add a few things which will conduce to the proving that it is not ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. That which was practiſed in primitive times, which was ordinary, is ſtill continuing. But the propheſying mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was ordinary. <hi>Ergo,</hi> That propheſying mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>The Major will not be denyed, if that which was practiſed then, which was ordinary, be not obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and binding to us, we are to ſeek for a Rule for our duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:120096:61"/>
The Minor is, That the propheſying mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was ordinary: for this, we may refer the Reader to Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s <hi>Due right of Presbyteries,</hi> p. 466, 467. where he proves by eight Arguments, That theſe very Prophets mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prophets. Indeed he aſſerteth that they were Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; in which he is againſt us: but if his Arguments will hold to prove that they are ordinary Prophets, then our Brethren muſt ſay, either that they are Prophets by gift onely, or elſe aſſert another ſort of ordinary Officers for propheſying, diſtinct from Paſtors and Teachers; or elſe retract and unſay what they have ſaid. For, in their <hi>Jus Divin. Minist.</hi> p. 97. they ſpeak thus: <q>The gift of prophecie is reckoned amongſt the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, and put in the midſt of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 11. and contradiſtinguiſhed from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts, verſ. 7, 8. <hi>The word of wiſdom, the word of knowledge:</hi> the word of wiſdom denotes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors work, the word of knowledge the Teachers work: but propheſying is different from both theſe.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here our Brethren do plainly aſſert, that propheſying is different from the work of Paſtors and Teachers; and therefore if propheſying prove an ordinary Office, and continuing, it muſt be a different office from Paſtor and Teacher. And here we cannot but obſerve how the Lord hath left them to a ſelf-contradiction, (if the <hi>ſundry Miniſters of London</hi> publiſhing the firſt Book, be of <hi>the province of London,</hi> which publiſhed the ſecond.) For in this Book called <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt.</hi> p. 96, 97, 98. they would ſtrongly urge it, that theſe Prophets are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers: but in their other Book, called <hi>Jus Divin. Regiminis,</hi> p. 228. they uſe theſe words: <q>And though theſe Prophets had extraordinary gifts, (as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> excelled all other Churches in gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7.) and were able to preach in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſingular way; yet were they the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Paſtors and Miniſters of that Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as the whole current of this 14 Chap. evidenceth; wherein (as <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in his <hi>Due Right of Presbyt.</hi> p. 466, 467. proves by eight Arguments they were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſtors.</note> ſome have well obſerved) ſo many Rules and Directions aptly agreeing to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors, are impoſed upon them, for the well-ordering of their Miniſterial exerciſes.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here they ſay theſe Prophets 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paſtors: what is this ſhort of flat ſelf-contradiction? Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Arguments, which they approved of very much, in writing their Book called <hi>Jus Divin. Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> whereby he proveth ordinary Prophets to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, we may now produce to anſwer their later book called <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt.</hi> wherein they aſſert the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to be extraordinary Officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſpeaketh thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They did here propheſie according to the Analogie of faith; and that they have common with Prophets now adays. 2. They are by the ſame rules regulated, that our Paſtors are now. 3. They exerciſe theſe ſame acts of Juriſdiction which Paſtors do now exerciſe. 1. They are to propheſie in a known tongue, verſ. 19, 20, 21, 22. and that to the edification and comfort of the Church, verſ. 31. even as Paſtors now adays: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the internal principle, to wit, the infuſed gift of prophecying, made them extraordinary prophets <hi>in fieri,</hi> as our prophets become prophets by ordinary induſtry and ſtudies, <hi>in fieri:</hi> but <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſubſtance of the acts of propheſying, theſe extraordinary prophets and our ordinary prophets and paſtors differ not in <hi>ſpecie</hi> and nature. As the eyes put in the man born blinde, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. and thoſe eyes which we ſuppoſe he was capable of from his mothers womb; and the wine miraculouſly made out of water by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. and the wines that grew in Judea,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120096:62"/>
according to their manner of production and <hi>in fieri</hi> differed, but <hi>in facto eſſe</hi> they were of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hence you ſee in the Text theſe Prophets are every way regulated as ordinary Prophets, and as the Prophets of the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>Becauſe it is acknowledged by all Interpreters, that the ſcope of the Chapter is to preſcribe what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decency in the publick worſhip in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as the laſt verſe ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order;</hi> and conſequently, how theſe Prophets ſhould edifie the Church of <hi>Corinth, v.</hi> 4, 12, 16, 17.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>That theſe Prophets ſhould not ſpeak in publick the language of a <hi>Barbarian, v.</hi> 11, 12. to the which the hearer could not ſay Amen, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and this way are our ordinary Prophets regulated, except the Papiſts will but ſay ſervice in Latine.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>A direction is put on the Prophets, on thoſe who ſpeak with tongues, that they be not Children in underſtanding; and that they be in malice as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but as concerning underſtanding, men, <hi>v.</hi> 20. which agreeth well to Prophets, as they are ordinary Paſtors.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>What more ordinary then the coming together of the whole Church for propheſying, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24. and convincing of unbelievers? as <hi>v.</hi> 25.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <q>The Prophets are to be limited to a way of ſpeaking to Edification; as he who ſpeaketh with tongues, who muſt ſpeak by an interpreter, or then be ſilent in the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <q>Theſe Prophets, as our ordinary Prophets, muſt ſpeak orderly, and that but one at once, to eſchew confuſion, <hi>v.</hi> 29.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <q>What they ſpeak, is to be judged, and put under cenſure; for the whole Colledge muſt judge, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 8.</q>

               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:120096:63"/>
8. <q>And as the women are here put under a Rule, when to ſpeak, and when to be ſilent, <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35. So are theſe Prophets: all which, and diverſe other Rules, do regulate our ordinary Prophets; which clearly ſaith to me, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherford,)</hi> that this is a patterne of a Colledge of ordinary Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have given you Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to prove that ordinary Prophers are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that place: we do not ſay, that every one of them is concluſive; but diverſe of them are very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: and poſſibly will be more readily received from his mouth, then from ours; and all laid together, they will amount to little leſs then that they are ordinary Prophets.</p>
               <p>That ſo many ordinary Rules ſhould be laid down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout propheſying, and none extraordinary; and that yet the act about which all the Rules are given, ſhould be concluded to be extraordinary, ſeemeth very ſtrange and ungrounded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Rules to regulate the work are ordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The deſcription of the work itſelf is ordinary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>He that propheſieth, ſpeaketh unto men unto edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exhortation, and comfort.</hi> This deſcription hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the act of propheſying, <hi>[exhortation,]</hi> and the ends of it <hi>[edification, and comfort.]</hi> It is true, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts were to be imployed to theſe ends of edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and comfort, and ſome things were ordinary in extraordinary Officers: exhortation for thoſe ends of edification and comfort, was not the proper work of extraordinary Prophets; but prediction, or foretelling things to come.</p>
               <p>He that hath a gift to ſpeak unto exhortation, edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort, hath all that is here required unto theſe Prophets: but a gift of prediction is required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides unto all extraordinary prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:120096:63"/>
In this Chapter no word is mentioned of foretelling future events, which is that which ſhould make them extraordinary Prophets; and diverſe ordinary acts are mentioned, and that largely: that their main work as extraordinary Officers, and ſo as Prophets, ſhould be omitted, if they had been ſuch, how improbable is it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. One great end of extraordinary propheſying is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to this propheſying; it was a great end of future events, (which is the proper act of extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) to be a ſigne: for, our Brethren give this as one evidence of an immediate Call to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. page</hi> 116.</note> the Miniſtry, The having the gift of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural prediction, or foretelling things to come. They uſe theſe words,—We ſay, That an immediate Call is alwayes joyned either with the gift of Miracles, or the gift of Tongues, or ſome other extraordinary thing, by which men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled undoubtedly to demonſtrate to others their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Call: thus the prophets were all of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the gift of foretelling things to come: and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was enabled to make proof of his immediate Call, by ſhewing the propheſies both of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> that were concerning him; which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were applyed to him by the Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17. before he was born, appropriated by himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 23. and confirmed by Chriſts Teſtimony of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 9, 10, 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which it appeareth, even from their own mouths, that as Miracles and the gift of Tongues were for a ſigne, ſo alſo was the extraordinary gift of propheſie, or foretelling things to come, for a ſigne, to evidence that they were no Impoſtors or Sadduces.</p>
               <p>Now, the propheſying ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was not for a ſigne, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. wherefore ſtrange Tongues are for a Signe, not to them that believe, but to them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:120096:64"/>
that believe not; but propheſying ſerveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</p>
               <p>The Antitheſis or oppoſition between the gift of tongues and propheſying, intimated in the particle [but,] doth evidence that the thing which is predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of tongues, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are for a ſigne, cannot be predicated of the propheſying there ſpoken of, that it is for a ſigne alſo. Were this propheſying for a ſigne, then it ſhould ſerve for thoſe that believe not, as the gift of tongues doth; which the Apoſtle expreſly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and therefore the propheſying ſpoken of, cannot be the extraordinary gift of foretelling things to come, which was a ſigne; and ſo it is an ordinary gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Women Propheteſſes are forbidden this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the Churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak: but they are commanded to be under obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as alſo ſaith the Law.</hi> But women Propheteſſes might have propheſied publickly, if they had received the extraordinary gifts of propheſie. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>And there was one Anna a Propheteſſe, the daughter of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel—v.</hi> 38. <hi>And ſhe coming in at that inſtant, gave thanks likewiſe unto the Lord, and ſpake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem.</hi> Here a woman Propheteſſe did with Divine allowance ſpeak publickly <hi>[to all—]</hi> and therefore in Goſpel-days it was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to women who had an extraordinary gift of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to ſpeak publickly.</p>
               <p>That publick propheſying which was not permitted unto women by the Word of God, was ordinary; for extraordinary propheſying was permitted unto women, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 36, 38. But the publick propheſying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was not permitted unto women by the Word of God, <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The publick propheſying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was ordinary; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:120096:64"/>
Neither can it be ſaid that before they had this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but now the Apoſtle taketh it a way; for, he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth their ſilence upon ſuch grounds as would before the promulgation of the Goſpel have made it unlawful for extraordinary propheteſſes to have taught publickly, as much as now. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 34.—<hi>but to be under obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law;</hi> intimating, that they ſhould tranſgreſs the Law, if they did not keep ſilence in the Churches; therefore it was no new, but an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prohibition fetched from the Law; and from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is another Argument againſt it, <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>For it is [a ſhame] for women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> All laid together, will ſpeak it to be an ordinary gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, and ſo ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. It is evident by the ſeries of this Chapter, that the Prophets her ſpoken of, and their propheſying was extraordinary, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>When</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>you are come together, every one of you hath a pſalm, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation:</hi> tongues, interpretation, revelation, are joyned together. <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace:</hi> by which it appears, that the prophets here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and that this gift of propheſie was an extraordinary Diſpenſation of God, given to the primitive Church, but now ceaſed.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſeries of the Chapter, (as hath been ſhewn) ſpeaketh the prophets and their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying to be ordinary: as for <hi>v.</hi> 26. if our Brethren would have recited all the words, it wonld have been evident enough that an ordinary gift may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; the words run thus, [—<hi>Every one of you hath a pſalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.—]</hi> our Brethren have left out thoſe words, <hi>[hath a doctrine]</hi> and then it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as if none but extraordinary gifts were mentioned.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:120096:65"/>
Such as have but ordinary gifts, have [a doctrine] as well as perſons extraordinarily gifted. Ordinary Elders <hi>labor in the word [and doctrine,]</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>And ought to be able by ſound [doctrine,] both to exhort and convince the gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1. 9. And therefore the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of tongues, interpretation, and revelation, doth not at all evidence, that propheſying is an extra or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift or Office: for doctrine is joyned with them, which is ordinary.</p>
               <p>Their Argument muſt run thus:</p>
               <p>That which is joyned with, or reckoned up amongſt extraordinary gifts, is extraordinary. But prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying is ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Ergo.</hi> And then the Major is eaſily denyed: for it is a common thing, to joyn and reckon up extraordinary and ordinary gifts together. And a like Argument we might uſe againſt them: that which is joyned with, or reckoned up amongſt ordinary gifts, is ordinary. But propheſying is ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Ergo,</hi> propheſying is ordinary. Yea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying (if mentioned at all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.) is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or expreſſed by what is ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>2. It is hard to determine that by revelation is meant propheſying, <hi>v.</hi> 26. for revelation is diſtinguiſhed from propheſying, <hi>v.</hi> 6.—<hi>except I ſhall ſpeak to you either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, or by knowledge, or by propheſying, or by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Here, revelation and propheſying ſeem not to be the ſame; and how will it be proved, that by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is meant propheſying, <hi>v.</hi> 26? if not, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument falleth: for it may be replyed, Propheſying is neither of thoſe three gifts which are joyned together, <hi>v.</hi> 26. If propheſying be ſpoken of, it is queſtionable whether it be expreſſed by [doctrine,] which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; or by revelation, which is ſuppoſed to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
               <p>3. There is ordinary revelation, as well as extra or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:120096:65"/>
if by revelation be meant propheſying, <hi>v.</hi> 26. yet there is no neceſſity that it ſhould be underſtood of immediate revelation; and if not, then it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. As there is an immediate revelation by the Spirit, ſo there is a mediate revelation by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word. The Spirit uſeth the Word, as a means whereby it giveth forth diſcoveries of the Will of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18.—<hi>making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wiſdome and [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation] in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He ſpeaketh here of ſuch revelations as are common to the Saints. When by the Goſpel they reach unto a knowledge of Chriſt, and the hope of his Calling, then they enjoy revelations. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.—<hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God [ſhall reveal] even this unto you.</hi> He doth not ſpeak of new revelations, but of a revelation of thoſe doctrines of the Goſpel, which he before had preached. Whence it is evident, that there are ordinary revelations, ſtill continuing. And this may anſwer the great Objection which ſome raiſe from <hi>ver.</hi> 30. Say they, Theſe prophets ſpake by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelation. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officers.</p>
               <p>We deny that they ſpake by extraordinary revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Text doth not enforce it. There was a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Church at <hi>Corinth, viz.</hi> Divers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did ſpeak together or at once in the aſſembly; and ſo edification was hindred: to rectifie this, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge.</hi> He would have two or three ſpeak, and the reſt hear, and be ſilent. But leſt two or three ſhould ſpeak at once, or leſt one ſhould ſpin out all the time, &amp; others who came prepared to ſpeak, ſhould want op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:120096:66"/>
to exerciſe their gifts, he directeth further, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace:</hi> i. e. Let not many ſpeak to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; before another beginneth, let the firſt be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: let one ſpeak a convenient time, and then hold his peace, and give way or place to others, that the gifts of others may be exerciſed as well as his: and a reaſon is added, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>For ye may all propheſie one by one:</hi> i. e. one after another, not many at once. Leſt they ſhould think that by this means the gifts of ſome would be cooped up, and their liberty for the exerciſe of them infringed; he tells them, no, <hi>they might [all] propheſie:</hi> i. e. all who were prophets: yet it muſt be orderly, one after another: but this doth not evidence the Apoſtles intent to be, that upon a ſubitaneous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe which another hath, the firſt muſt abruptly break off, and hold his peace.</p>
               <p>The requiring the firſt to hold his peace, doth not neceſſarily either forbid his proceeding ſo far as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or command a ſudden ſilence in the midſt of a diſcourſe, upon anothers having a ſudden revelation, to give way to that; but it forbiddeth the ſpeaking of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers together in the ſame aſſembly, and commandeth ſo to contract a mans diſcourſe, as there may be oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for others who come prepared to ſpeak, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their gifts alſo.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be concluded, that they propheſied by immediate inſpiration, without any previous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, becauſe what they ſpake is ſaid to be [reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] to them; For, Goſpel-truths are revealed, by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, induſtry, and the uſe of ordinary means, as well as by immediate inſpiration, as we proved before; and therefore no ground can be fetched from <hi>ver.</hi> 30. that can argue theſe Prophets to be extraordinaty Officers. Indeed the immediate Revelations and real motions of the Divine Spirit do not uſe to interfere with, interrupt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:120096:66"/>
and juſtle out one another, as according to ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation they ſhould do. If the firſt did ſpeak by immediate revelation, and muſt ſuddenly hold his peace before he hath finiſhed his diſcourſe, or fully declared his Revelations, that another might diſcover his; then the motions of the ſame Spirit ſhould claſh each with other, and the Spirit ſhould interrupt it ſelf; which it were an impeachment to the wiſdom of the Spirit for any to affirm.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Prophets are mentioned with a note of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 29, 30. <hi>Are all Prophets?</hi> Ergo, <hi>Propheſie was a miraculous extraordinary gift.</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A note of ſingularity is proper to them, becauſe all had not the gift of propheſie. Some Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members were not prophets.</p>
               <p>2. It doth not follow, That therefore propheſie was a miraculous extraordinary gift; For, the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift of Teaching is expreſſed with a note of ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alſo in the very ſame <hi>verſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? [Are all Teachers?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>Prophets in all the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſignifie ſome in Office peculiarly call'd and ſent.</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 20. 1 Sam. 22. 5. Act. 13. 1. Act. 21. 10, 11. Act. 11. 27, 28. <hi>The word Propheſying is uſed generally in the New Teſtament for that which is extraordinary and by Revelation.</hi> Matth. 26. 68. Rev. 1. 3. Act. 21. 9. Luk. 1. 67. Rev. 22. 10, 19. Rev. 10. 11. Mark 7. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. Jud. 14. Luk. 1. 76. <hi>and</hi> 7. 28. Matth. 21. 26, 14, 5. Mat 13. 57. Matth. 7. 22. Act. 19. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Joh. 11. 51. 1 Tim. 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We have given many reaſons to evidence that the prophets, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. are neither Officers, nor perſons extraordinarily gifted: and propheſie being the chief ſubject of that <hi>Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hence the acceptation of the word propheſie in that place, is more likely to be found in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> then to be fetched from other
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:120096:67"/>
places which do not purpoſely treat of that ſubject. And if the word were uſed there in a different ſenſe from what it beareth in all other places, yet there may be enough there to clear that to be the ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>2. It is queſtionable, Whether the word prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying be uſed in diverſe of thoſe places mentioned, either for Officers or perſons extraordinarily gifted: as <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. It is one thing for the perſons who are prophets to have extraordinary gifts, and another thing for them to have the extra or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift of propheſie. Thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. might have power to work miracles, to caſt out Devils, yet their propheſying might be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift, as <hi>Stephen</hi> had extraordinary gifts. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 8. Stephen <hi>full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</hi> And yet he had the ordinary Office of a Deacon upon him for all that, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. It may as well be argued, that the Office of a Deacon is extraordinary, becauſe <hi>Stephen,</hi> a Deacon, wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as that the prophets, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were extraordinary, becauſe they wrought miracles.—</p>
               <p>3. It appeareth to us, as a certain truth, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying is uſed in the New Teſtament for that which is neither an extraordinary Office, nor an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 57.—<hi>But Jeſus ſaid unto them, A Prophet is not without honor, ſave in his own Country, and in his own houſe.</hi> Here the perſon ſpeaking was indeed an extraordinary prophet; but the rule he layeth down is general, and cannot be reſtrained unto him onely, or to extraordinary prophets: for, can any imagine that the ſenſe ſhould only be this, <hi>He that foretelleth things to come, is not without honor, ſave in his own Country?</hi> Surely it extendeth to all faithfull Teachers or publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Goſpel-Myſteries, for they are ſubject to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in their own country and houſe, as well as they which foretel things to come; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>No prophet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:120096:67"/>
is accepted in his own Country.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41. <hi>He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a prophets reward.</hi> Will any ſay, that this promiſe runs onely to ſuch as receive extraordinary prophets? Surely the meaning is, He that ſo receiveth any Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-preacher, he ſhall have a reward: ordinary Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Word, are here called prophets three times in one verſe.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>And Judas and Silas being prophets alſo themſelves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them:</hi> Exhorting is the work of prophets. Here propheſying and exhorting are mentioned as one and the ſame thing; for their exhorting is ſaid to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were prophets. Take the words of <hi>Calvin</hi> on this place; ſaith he, They were prophets: whereas the word hath divers ſignifications: it is not taken in this place for thoſe prophets to whom it was granted to foretel things to come, becauſe this title ſhould come in out of ſeaſon when he intreateth of another matter: but <hi>Luke</hi> his meaning is, that <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with excellent knowledge and underſtanding of the myſteries of God, that they might be good Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God: as <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourteenth of the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he intreateth of the propheſie, and preferreth it before all other gifts, ſpeaketh not of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come, but he commendeth it for this fruit, becauſe it doth edifie the Church by doctrine, exhortation and conſolation. After this manner doth <hi>Luke</hi> aſſigne exhortation to the prophets, as being the principal point of their Office.</p>
               <p>By all this it appeareth, that although he counted prophets to be Officers; yet he did not account the propheſie mentioned here, nor 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. to be the extraordinary gift of foretelling things to come. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 3. the witneſſes are ſaid to propheſie a thouſand two hundred and three ſcore days—It is doubtful
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:120096:68"/>
what this propheſying of the witneſſes is, neither is that material to the buſineſs in hand; but this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that either the extraordinary gift of propheſying did not ceaſe in the primitive times, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying of the witneſſes is one thouſand two hundred ſixty days, and therefore did undoubtedly continue many hundred years ſince; or elſe it muſt be granted, that there is an ordinary propheſying owned in the Goſpel; and ſo the word propheſying, is not generally uſed in the New Teſtament for that which is extraordinary and by revelation. And ſo the Objection is anſwered. Some are called in Scripture-ſence prophets, by way of reſemblance, who do not foretel things to come. As the Scripture in general, and the Goſpel in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, is called a word of prophecie, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure [word of propheſie.—] v.</hi> 30.—<hi>[No propheſying] of the Scripture is of any private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:</hi> yet a great part of the Scripture doth not contain predictions of future events. So, thoſe that have a gift of Scripture-interpretation or expoſition, may be called prophets by way of reſemblance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no gift to foretel things to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. Propheſie is reckoned as one of the rareſt gifts the Apoſtles had, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 16. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the gift of tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1, 2. <hi>Paul</hi> compareth himſelf with theſe prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the gift is extraordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle preferreth propheſie before the gift of tongues, and ſpeaketh of its excellency, not for any thing in it extraordinary, that yet we finde; but, for its uſefulneſs beyond other gifts, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary end of edification, as appeareth by his own words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>He that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, ſpeaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man underſtandeth him: howbeit in the ſpirit he ſpeaketh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</hi> v. 3. <hi>But he that propheſieth, ſpeaketh unto
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:120096:68"/>
men to edification,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle granteth that he who had the gift of tongues did ſpeak myſteries, as well as he that propheſied: but the rarity and excellencie of propheſie he placeth in its tendency and conducible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to edification, beyond the gift of tongues which men underſtood not, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>for no man underſtandeth him.</hi>—</p>
               <p>And hence verſs. 4. <hi>He that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himſelf;</hi> there is a particular good: <hi>but he that propheſieth, edifieth the Church;</hi> there is a more general good: and in that reſpect, propheſie is better then tongues. verſ. 5. <hi>I would that ye all ſpake with tongues, but rather that ye propheſied: for greater is he that propheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the Church may receive edifying.</hi> Which implieth, that if he doth interpret, that ſo the Church may underſtand and be edified, then he that propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, may not be greater then he that ſpeaketh with tongues. So verſ. 6. It is in reſpect of the end, <hi>viz.</hi> edification, that propheſie is preferred before other gifts.</p>
               <p>What the Apoſtle ſpeaketh about propheſie, may aptly be ſpoken concerning the ordinary gifts of Paſtors or Teachers: <hi>Greater is he that teacheth, then he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with tongues, except he interpret, that the Church may receive edifying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ordinary gift of a Paſtor or Teacher is better as to edification, then ſpeaking with tongues, which no man underſtandeth; and therefore the preferring of propheſie before the gift of tongues for ſuch an end, doth not evidence an extraordinary gift of propheſie to be intended.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi>'s comparing himſelf with the prophets, proves nothing extraordinary; for ſuch was his humility, as he compared himſelf with ordinary Chriſtians; yea, ſeemeth to prefer them before himſelf, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Unto
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:120096:69"/>
me who am leſs then the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> &amp;c. But how he compareth himſelf with the prophets, or equalizeth them with himſelf, we finde not in the place alledged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. becauſe prophets are required to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the doctrines of the Apoſtles to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord: for any to ſay therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are compared to the Apoſtles in a way of equality; it is a far-fetched concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. The formal effect of publick edifying, comforting, convincing, converting ſouls, are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to theſe prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 24, 25, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This proveth not that they are extraordinary gifts or Offices which are mentioned: for, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts of Paſtors and Teachers are uſeful to ſuch ends.</p>
               <p>Indeed we know not wherefore gifted men ſhould propheſie, if there were no hope of ſuch effects of their exerciſing their gifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. The Apoſtle plainly diſtinguiſhed this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying from the word of knowledge, and the word of wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It doth not follow, that therefore it is an extraordinary gift, or any Office at all. Ordinary gifts may be diſtinguiſhed from the gifts of Paſtors and Teachers, becauſe of the different way and manner of laying them out, although the gifts themſelves be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Propheſie is diſtinguiſhed from exhortation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. and yet it was the proper work of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to exhort, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>But he that propheſieth, ſpeaketh unto men to edification, [exhortation,] and comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is often difficult to determine what is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſon of the Apoſtles diſtinguiſhing thoſe things from each other, which in themſelves ſeem alike. It will be hard for our Brethren to ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:120096:69"/>
ſpeaking by revelation, by knowledge, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, and by doctrine; and yet theſe are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed each from other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 6.</p>
               <p>3. If becauſe propheſying is diſtinguſhed from the word of knowledge, and the word of wiſdome; they will conclude, that by propheſying muſt be underſtood a gift of foretelling things to come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10. Then ſeeing the main work of thoſe prophets, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is to exhort, thereby to convince and convert, as <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 24, 25. Hence it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that there are two ſorts of prophets, or that the prophets mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. are not the ſame with thoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. for the proper diſtinctive act of the former prophets is to foretel future events; and of the latter, to exhort for conviction, comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this will make much for us, and againſt our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 7. But it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Whether there be propheſies, they ſhall fail.</hi> Ergo, propheſying is ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Read on, ver. 9, 10. and thence you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the time of the ceaſing of propheſie, is not until that which is perfect cometh. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>For we know in part, and we propheſie in part: but when that which is perfect is come, [then] that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> It is the coming of that which is perfect, that is concluded to be the cauſe of the ceſſation of propheſie, which is but in part. And therefore this is a ſtrong Argument to prove that propheſying is ſtill continuing, becauſe that which is perfect is not yet come; and until then, propheſie doth not ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the time of the ceaſing of propheſie is not until the ceaſing of knowledge in part: for, both are taken away by the coming of that which is perfect, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>We [know] in part, and propheſie in part: but when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120096:70"/>
that which is perfect is come,</hi> &amp;c. And alſo it is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſo long as knowledge is but in part, that which is perfect is not come; for, when perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is come, then that which is in part, <hi>i. e.</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in knowledge, ſhall be done away, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. Imperfect knowledge and propheſie ceaſe both at the ſame time, and by one and the ſame means, <hi>viz.</hi> by the coming of that which is perfect. And it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in general of the ceaſing of gifts, then he mentioneth the gift of tongues alſo, ver. 8.—<hi>Whether there be propheſies, they ſhall fail; whether there be propheſies, they ſhall ceaſe; whether there be knowledge, it ſhall vaniſh away.</hi> But when he mentioneth the coming of that which is perfect, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the time and means in and by which ſome gifts do ceaſe, then he reckoneth up onely knowledge and propheſie; <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 10. He doth not ſay, that tongues ceaſe by the coming of that which is perfect; they may be ceaſed long ago, and yet propheſie be ſtill contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. We argue thus:</p>
               <p>That which doth not ceaſe ſo long as we know but in part; nor until that which is perfect is come, that is ſtill continuing: For yet we know but in part, and as yet that which is perfect is not come. But prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying doth not ceaſe ſo long as we know but in part, nor until that which is perfect is come, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Ergo,</hi> propheſying is ſtill continuing. <hi>Ergo,</hi> propheſying is either but an ordinary gift, and no Office: or elſe it muſt be aſſerted, that an extraordinary gift, or a preaching Office, diſtinct from Paſtors and Teachers, is ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. But this propheſying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was in the Church, and is ſaid, <hi>Not to ſerve for thoſe that believe not, but for them which believe,</hi> verſ. 22. How can this warrant the preaching of gifted men out of the Church, to the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:120096:70"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it warranteth the preaching of gifted men in publick Church-aſſemblies, that is the great thing denyed by our Brethren. They grant them a liberty in ſome caſes to preach where no Churches are ſetled.</p>
               <p>2. The Apoſtles intent ſeemeth to be, to deny that propheſie is appointed for a ſigne to confirm the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel to unbelievers, as tongues were, verſ. 22. <hi>Wherefore tongues are for a ſigne, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not:</hi> and by way of Antitheſis, or Oppoſition to this, he addeth, <hi>but propheſying ſerveth not for them that believe not,</hi> (i. e. not to be a ſigne to them as tongues are) <hi>but for them which believe,</hi> i. e. to edifie them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 5. his intent cannot be to deny, that propheſie is uſeful to unbeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; for he aſſerteth it to be a means of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>But if all propheſie, and there come in one that believeeh not, or one unlearned, he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all, he is judged of all: and thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Propheſie then ſerveth for the conviction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe that believe not: this doth warrant the preaching of gifted men to unbelievers, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And thus we have given our Arguments for the preaching of gifted Brethren: the laſt, which is taken from the Rules about propheſying: we formerly did not account ſo cogent as ſome other, but now (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have further light) we account it at leaſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Argument, which joyned with others, hath great force in it.</p>

               <p>As to the firſt, it is queſtionable what they mean by [aſſuming the Office of the Miniſtry;] if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely this, that none may take upon them ſuch a relation to a Church without Ordination; or rather thus, That all who aſſume the Office of a Paſtor or Teacher, ought to be ordained: we might grant all their Arguments which they produce, to ſhore up this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet gifted Brethren might ſtill have a full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to preach in publick aſſemblies, though not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained: For it is not preaching <hi>ex Officio,</hi> but <hi>ex dono,</hi> that we plead for. But by ſeveral expreſſions, they have given us cauſe to think that they have a further reach, <hi>viz.</hi> to deny the lawfulneſs of any mans preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or doing ſuch work of the Miniſtry without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo both propoſitions make but one; for they ſay, <hi>page</hi> 67. It is manifeſt that there be ſome who conſtantly ſupply the room of preachers, and arrogate
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120096:71"/>
to themſelves the reverence and maintenance due to none but Miniſters; and yet they themſelves were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordained to this Office.—And in reference to this, their firſt <hi>Theſis</hi> ſeemeth to be put in. And again, <hi>page</hi> 76. they uſe theſe words: Having in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter aſſerted the neceſſity of Ordination, to [the work of the Miniſtry] againſt the preſumptuous uſurpation of ſuch as run and are not ſent: we ſhall by the grace of God, in this Chapter, vindicate the work of the Miniſtry, unto thoſe whom God hath ſet as Officers in his Church.</p>
               <p>By which words, we gather that their deſigne in the firſt poſition, is to deny that any may do [the work of the Miniſtry] without Ordination. And how they can diſtinguiſh or difference it from the ſecond poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they take it in that ſenſe, we find not. We ſhall reply to ſuch Arguments, as under either do ſeem to ſpeak againſt the preaching of gifted men without Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>And how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi>—the form of the expreſſion makes it morally impoſſible to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 68, 69.</note> preach without miſſion.—As no man to the end of the world can call upon him in whom he believes not, or believe in him of whom he hears not, or hear without a preacher; ſo it is and will be true to the end of the world, that no man can preach except he be ſent. From all they gather,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That miſſion is eſſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, How ſhall they preach, except they be gifted, (though this be true) but, <hi>how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> implying that gifting without ſending doth not conſtitute a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this miſſion is not onely of extraordinary, but of ordinary Teachers, becauſe faith is as much
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:120096:72"/>
annexed to their teaching, as teaching to their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is a neceſſity of a conſtant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as well as of an ordinary miſſion. If faith depends upon hearing, hearing upon preaching, preaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on miſſion; then if faith be neceſſary in all ages of the world, miſſion is alſo neceſſary; yea, ordinary miſſion, becauſe extraordinary is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> putteth the Argument into this form. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>What none may ordinarily do but thoſe that are ſent, that private gifted perſons may not do ordinarily. But none may preach, but thoſe that are ſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
               <p>The Major he endeavoureth to prove thus:</p>
               <p>What none can ordinarily do, but thoſe that are ſent, that thoſe cannot do, that are not ſent. But private perſons, though gifted, and deſired, are not ſent. This he would prove from the ſending there meant, which he concludeth cannot be onely a ſending from God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but muſt neceſſarily be meant of a mediate miſſion from God, and that muſt be either by the civil power which none will ſay, or by the Church, not by the whole Church in chuſing.—And therefore by the Presbytery, there muſt concur a commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the perſon to the work, by ſuch perſons as have authority from Chriſt to do it. This is the ſum of what is expreſſed in many more words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be granted:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That miſſion is not onely of extraordinary, but of ordinary Teachers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That miſſion continueth in all ages of the world. But we deny that miſſion is eſſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter; neither doth the Text conclude any ſuch thing: for it may properly be ſaid, <hi>How ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> and yet ſending not be eſſential
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:120096:72"/>
unto the conſtituting of a man a preacher. We do not ſay, that gifts without a Divine command, do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a preacher, but yet the words of that Text do not deny it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle there, neither denyeth gifts, nor affirmeth ſending to be conſtitutive of a Miniſter: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Miſſion may be neceſſary unto preaching, and yet not be neceſſary unto the conſtitution of a preacher: the Text doth not neceſſarily enforce ſending to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite unto the making of a preacher, but rather unto the act of preaching, <hi>[How ſhall they preach:—],</hi> for all thoſe words might be aptly uſed about the Apoſtles or others, who were before conſtituted Miniſters. We may ſay, How ſhall a people hear without a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and how ſhall they preach except they enjoy ſome meaſure of health, ſtrength, liberty, under a great ſickneſs, or bodily weakneſs, or impriſonment where none come at them to hear? they that are Officers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach, and yet health, ſtrength and liberty are not eſſential to the conſtitution of a preacher, for then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch ſickneſs, weakneſs, or impriſonment, a man ſhould ceaſe to be one, becauſe he ſhould loſe what is eſſentially conſtitutive of a preacher. It may be ſaid, how ſhall a man preach as an Officer to a Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the peoples election? Yet, our Brethren will not ſay, that the peoples election is eſſential to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of an Officer.</p>
               <p>Therefore the interrogation doth not imply, that ſending is eſſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter, but onely that it is neceſſary unto ſome miniſtrations. It doth not imply, that miſſion doth make a preacher, but that it is requiſite unto acts of preaching, <hi>[How ſhall they preach?—]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be both naturally and morally impoſſible to preach without miſſion, and yet miſſion may not be eſſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter, or Preacher:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:120096:73"/>
It may aptly be ſaid, How ſhall an Officer preach, except he be where there are ſome to hear? he cannot preach in a wilderneſs or a priſon, where none are to hear; yet his being where ſome are to hear, is not eſſential to the conſtituting of him a Miniſter: for then ſo often as he were alone, ſo often he ſhould ceaſe to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, becauſe he ſhould loſe what is eſſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>How can they preach warrantably, lawfully and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, without all thoſe circumſtances which by Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules are requiſite unto a preacher and preaching? yet who will ſay that all thoſe circumſtances are eſſential to the conſtitution of a preacher? He may ſin in being without thoſe, and yet may have whatever is eſſential to conſtitute him a Miniſter, elſe there are but few Miniſters conſtituted in the world; for who hath all thoſe things which are required to be in preachers? Therefore the form of the expreſſion doth not enforce miſſion to be eſſential to the conſtitution of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their argument, if granted, doth not prove what they produce it for. If it be morally impoſſible to preach without miſſion, yet it doth not follow thence, that none may aſſume the Office of the Miniſtry, unleſs he be ſolemnly ſet apart thereunto; which was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they undertook to prove. Their argument ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the ſolemn ſetting apart called Ordination, to be all one with miſſion; which is a thing we deny, and they have not proved. If we ſhould grant that miſſion is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter, yet we might deny a ſolemn ſetting apart, to be eſſential thereunto, unleſs they can prove that Ordination and miſſion are the ſame.</p>
               <p>As to the argument as urged by <hi>Mr. Collings,</hi> if that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And then ſome may preach by gift who are not ſent, without croſſing this Text.</p>
               <p>We deny the Major of his firſt, and Minor of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Syllogiſm; and we aſſert, That perſons gifted (which he calleth private perſons, becauſe nor ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though their work be publick) and deſired, are ſent.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, we ſhall endeavor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what miſſion or ſending it is: And becauſe this is ſo much inſiſted upon, we ſhall ſhew, 1. <hi>Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> What the ſending cannot be. 2. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> What ſending (according to the acceptation of the word in other Scriptures) it may be.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is not Miſſion, or ſending?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Miſſion or ſending is not a call to Office, or any act which doth conſtitute a man an Officer or preacher: it is not ſutable to our Brethrens own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor to ours, to aſſert it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſome that were Officers and had a call to preach before, yet had miſſion afterward; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were Officers, had a call and did preach before the death or reſurrection of Chriſt, yet they had miſſion after it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations.</hi>—For Chriſt to ſay <hi>[Go.—]</hi> is for him to ſend thoſe that are ſpoken to. They were Officers, preachers before, and therefore could not be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch by this act, which was ſubſequent to it. A call to Office, and ſending, may differ as <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and therefore they cannot be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe miſſion may be iterated and repeated without loſing Office; but (according to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns principles) ſo cannot the call to Office, or that which conſtituteth a man a preacher: they judge that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:120096:74"/>
there ought to be no iteration of that, once an Officer and alwayes ſo, unleſs depoſed. But miſſion was ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and commanded them, ſaying, Goe not into the way of the Gentiles.</hi>—ver. 6. <hi>But go rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>And as you go, Preach.</hi>—Here is miſſion or ſending to preach, and they were the twelve Apoſtles that were ſent, who are named, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4. and yet the ſame perſons had miſſion again. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach.</hi>—and <hi>v.</hi> 16. it was the eleven Diſciples which he ſpake to. And hence alſo our Brethren muſt either grant, that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be iterated, or elſe that miſſion and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are not the ſame, becauſe miſſion is repeated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe ſome had miſſion to preach, who were not Officers that we can finde, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeventy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>After theſe things the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed other ſeventy alſo, and ſent them two and two.</hi>—Let them prove that theſe were Officers, who will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it; here is ſending, and yet we finde not that any Officers were conſtituted thereby, and therefore ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not a conſtitutive Office-making act.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe, then all that are inſtrumental to others converſion would thereby be proved and evidenced to be Officers, and all that are undoubtedly no Officers would be left hopeleſs that their inſtructions ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take place to the converſion of others: for, it is made as impoſſible for any to beleeve without a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſent, as it is for any to preach without being ſent: the interrogation runneth through all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>How ſhall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore if ſome doe hear the word and beleeve, there is a preacher ſent, or elſe the interrogation hath not the force of a negation, and then their whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:120096:74"/>
againſt the preaching of gifted men falleth. That gifted men unordained may be inſtrumental to bring others to beleeving, Scripture and experience hath witneſſed; and this evinceth that they are preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſent, and Officers, according to their own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>2. Miſſion or ſending is not Ordination: ſending and ordaining are different things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe no Scripture (that yet we can finde) doth make miſſion and Ordination one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if ſending be ordaining, then Deacons are ſent, for they are ordained, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. But we read not of their miſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe miſſion may be iterated, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. But (according to our Brethrens principles) Ordination may not be iterated or repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe the nature of the act (if men be the ſenders) forbiddeth it: for, if a Church hath a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery within it ſelf, then undenyably that presbytery may ordain other officers for that Church, and then they ſend to themſelves, if ordaining be ſending: for, they ordain them Officers to themſelves; elſe, in caſe any of the ordainers ſhould deſerve cenſuring, the ordained cannot (as Officers) cenſure them. And our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſay, <hi>(Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 69.) The ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot be the perſon ſending, and the perſons ſent unto. And ſending neceſſarily implyeth diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the party ſent, and thoſe to whom he is ſent, if the uſual acceptation of the word ſending be followed in a proper ſenſe. Now, if a Church hath a presbytery, and that ordaineth Officers, the Church being preſent (as it was when they ordained Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6.) how can it be ſaid, that the presbytery doth by the act
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:120096:75"/>
of ordaining, ſend them unto that Church which is preſent at the ſame time?</p>
               <p>3. Barely the gifting men for the work of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not ſending: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>He gave them power againſt unclean Spirits, to caſt them out, and to heal all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſeaſe.</hi> Here the twelve were gifted, yea, had authority given them for the performing of ſuch acts: for it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He gave them authority,</hi> or right, or a lawful power to do theſe works; the word is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. and yet as a diſtinct act afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and commanded them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Go not into the way of the Gentiles.</hi>—ver. 6, 7. <hi>But go rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and as ye go preach.</hi>—Here was their miſſion, and it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from, and ſubſequent to their being gifted, and receiving a lawful power to exerciſe thoſe gifts: and therefore ſending can neither be a gifting, nor an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing men to preach; but preſuppoſeth them to be gifted and authorized.</p>
               <p>Sending doth not make them preachers, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to be preachers before: and hence, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>He ordained twelve, that they ſhould be with him, and that he might ſend them forth to preach.</hi> It is made the end of his ordaining, conſtituting, and making the twelve, that he might ſend them forth to preach; and therefore their ſending was conſequential to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained or conſtituted. For the end is laſt in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, though it be firſt in intention. The means is firſt and in order, before the production of the end. And if conſtituting and ſending were the ſame things, then thoſe words ſhould ſound thus: He ſent twelve, that they ſhould be with him, and that he might ſend them forth to preach. And becauſe it is groſly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to ſay he ſent them, that he might ſend them; therefore the conſtituting or making of the twelve, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120096:75"/>
their ſending forth were different things: So <hi>Luk.</hi> 9, 1, 2. The giving them power and a lawful right to act, is diſtinguiſhed from ſending. Firſt, he gave them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. there is both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>poteſtatis;</hi> and yet ſending is diſtinct from and after both. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>And he ſent them to preach.</hi> Therefore ſending is neither gifting nor authorizing of men to preach. Thus negatively, what is not miſſion or ſending.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is [ſending] in Scripture-ſenſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is either Chriſts commanding by his word, or aſſigning preachers, to go and publiſh the Goſpel unto ſuch perſons or ſuch a people. 2. Or ſending is a providential diſpoſing of preachers, to ſuch perſons or ſuch a people, as Chriſt hath commanded or aſſigned the Goſpel to be publiſhed unto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sending is Chriſts commanding by his word, or aſſigning preachers, to go and publiſh the Goſpel unto ſuch perſons or ſuch a people. In this, deſcription of miſſion, there is declared:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who is the perſon ſending, [Chriſt;] neither a Church nor a presbytery, but Chriſt only can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or aſſign the Goſpel to be preached to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or ſuch a people; either a Church or presbyters may exhort and deſire preachers to go unto ſuch perſons, as Chriſt hath commanded or aſſigned the Goſpel to be preached to; but it is Chriſt alone that hath the power to command and aſſign it to be publiſhed to ſuch or ſuch: and hence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19.—<hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth, Go ye therefore and teach all Nations.</hi>—[Therefore] becauſe [all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er] is given to Chriſt, therefore he giveth forth this command, which is a miſſion to all lawful preachers; <hi>[Go—and teach]</hi> neither ſhall they need queſtion,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:120096:76"/>
whether this or that people may by Chriſts miſſion be preached to, ſeeing he is not now with them to give forth immediate commands whither they ſhould go, as in the time of his being on earth; for Chriſts miſſion extendeth to all ſorts of perſons, in all places and ages, to the end of the world. <hi>[Go,—Teach all Nations, &amp;c.]</hi> But ſtill it is Chriſt that ſaith <hi>[Go.] Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>And [he]</hi> i. e. Chriſt, <hi>ſent them to preach.</hi>—And the Lord complains, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>[I] ſent them not.</hi> It is the work of God and Chriſt only to ſend, let it be proved where ever a Presbytery was impowred to ſend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Who are the perſons ſent, [Preachers, or gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men impowred to preach.] We proved before, that miſſion doth not make a man a Preacher, but preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth him to be one. The eleven Apoſtles were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before, and yet had a miſſion after Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go.</hi>—Hence, if ſuch as are not gifted or impowred undertake to preach, they are not ſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To whom they are ſent, <hi>viz.</hi> [to ſuch perſons or ſuch a people, as by Chriſts command are to have the Goſpel publiſhed to them.] Miſſion doth not make it lawful for ſuch a perſon to preach, but for a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to publiſh the will of Chriſt to ſuch a people. Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily implyeth that ſome or other are ſent to; now if a man could go and publiſh truths of Chriſt to ſuch perſons as Chriſt had not commanded them to be revealed to, he might be ſaid [not to be ſent] though he were a lawful preacher who did it. As for example, The twelve Apoſtles were authorized by Chriſt to preach, and ſent by him to the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Go,—to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and as ye go, Preach,</hi>—Here is miſſion: yet if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had gone with this meſſage to the Gentiles at this time, they had run without being ſent, though they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:120096:76"/>
were lawful preachsrs; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>[Go not] into the way of the Gentiles.</hi> That which made the Apoſtles miſſion to the Jews, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>[Go,]</hi> that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denyed as to the Gentiles <hi>[Go not.]</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſſion is not the impowring of men to preach, but the impowring of preachers to doe ſuch a meſſage to ſuch perſons or ſuch a people. If any were excluded out of Chriſts miſſion, it were to run without being ſent to preach to them; but Chriſts miſſion is general. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go teach all Nations.</hi> Not that every individual preacher is required to go into all nations, and teach in them; but every Goſpel-preacher in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever nation his lot it caſt, or wherever in a nation he is fixed, yet he doth ſhare in this miſſion, Chriſt ſaith to him, Go teach, becauſe no people in any nation are excepted from teaching. Yet Goſpel-rules are to be obſerved, that a man preacheth not in this or that place, without the due requiſites thereunto; and theſe being found, he may ſafely conclude, that Chriſt ſaith to him, Go, teach this people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What is the meſſage which is ſent: they are to [publiſh the Goſpel;] not that thereby we exclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the will or counſel of God, but their great errand is, to tell them of the glad tidings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; as <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>[Go ye into all the world,]</hi> there is their miſſion, <hi>[and preach the Goſpel.—]</hi> there is their meſſage. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that [preach the Goſpel] of peace.</hi>—and hence <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>[The Prophets propheſie lies in my name]</hi> in ſtead of declaring the truths of God, they vented lies; and then ſaith the Lord, <hi>[I ſent them not.—] they propheſie unto you a falſe viſion, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.</hi> and ver. 15. Jerem. 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>They cauſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to erre.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>They ſpeak a viſion of their own heart,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120096:77"/>
and not out of the mouth of the Lord:</hi> and then the Lord ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets.</hi> We doe not finde that theſe are blamed for propheſying being no Prophets; but being Prophets, they are upbraided for not propheſying right things, for not carrying a right meſſage unto this people. Sending is not made the call unto the Office of Prophets; it appeareth not but that they had this, but they carryed ſuch news as God ſent them not with. They had allowance to propheſie the truth, as is plain, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they Propheſied.</hi> ver. 22. <hi>But if they had ſtood in my Counſel, and had cauſed my people to hear my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evil way, and from the evill of their doings.</hi> By <hi>[Counſel]</hi> may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Doctrine, as <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27. <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all [the Counſel]</hi> i. e. the Doctrine <hi>of God.</hi> And then it runneth thus: If they had ſtood in my Doctrines, &amp;c. if they had propheſied pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Gods word, then they ſhould have profited the people; but becauſe they propheſied falſe dreams, therefore he declareth that he ſent them not. By all this it is evident, that theſe were Prophets rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lord: for would the Lord entayl his bleſſing upon the labors of falſe Prophets, as it was upon theirs, if they had declared his words, <hi>ver.</hi> 22? Surely they that might have ſuch an aſſurance of ſucceſs in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, might lawfully preach the word of God. And therefore how impertinently is this place alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preaching of gifted men? theſe Prophets (by Gods own teſtimony) had allowance to preach Gods word; they are not blamed for propheſying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a call, but for venting falſe Doctrine: and when thoſe who are rightly ordained to Office-work, do ſpeak the viſion of their own hearts, this is as applicable to them as it was to theſe Prophets. If Paſtors or Teachers
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:120096:77"/>
rightly called do, in theſe days preach lies, in ſtead of truth to the people, the Lord ſaith the ſame to them' <hi>they ran, and I ſent them not:</hi> i. e. ſent them not with that meſſage. The Lord doth ſend them to preach the Goſpel: when they ſwerve from that; they are not ſent, though the ſame perſons before and after, may properly be ſaid to be ſent, when they preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is the work offending: <hi>viz.</hi> [command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or aſſigning to go.] <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us? then I ſaid, here am I, ſend me.</hi> And how doth he ſend him? ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>And he ſaid, Go and tell this people.</hi>—So that for God to ſend, is for him to command to do ſuch a work. So <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>[I ſent them not.]</hi> What is that? <hi>[neither have I commanded them.]</hi> Jerem. 23. v. 21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran; I have not ſpoken to them.</hi>—Matth. 10. v. 5. <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and commanded them, ſaying, Go not.</hi>—v. 6. <hi>But go.</hi>—So that undenyable, ſending of Preachers, is Chriſts commanding of them to go, and preach to ſuch a people. <hi>And they are not ſent,</hi> who are not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome command of Chriſt, to publiſh the Goſpel unto ſuch perſons. Indeed they that have not a command or warrant from the Goſpel of Chriſt to preach, they may be ſaid to run without being ſent; yet not as if miſſion or ſending were that which did authorize to Preach, or made it lawful for a man to preach, who elſe might not lawfully do it; but becauſe that man cannot have a command from Chriſt to preach to ſuch or ſuch perſons, (which is the work of ſending, or that wherein the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of miſſion doth conſiſt) without he hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or warrant to preach. Chriſt never ſaith to any man, Go preach to ſuch perſons, until he hath firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to preach. He that is not commanded to do the work of preaching, cannot rationally be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:120096:78"/>
to be commanded to preach to ſuch perſons, and ſo he may be ſaid to be unſent, becauſe he wanteth the prerequiſites unto ſending.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome object from <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14. That he is a falſe Prophet, not onely that teacheth lies, but who is not ſent; The Prophet telleth them plainly, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. That his not commanding them to propheſie to that people what they did, was his not ſending of them. The ſame things might have been propheſied to another people at Gods command, and might have been no lies, but truths. Had they propheſied what God commanded, they had been ſent.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How, or by what means Chriſt doth command to go and preach; <hi>viz.</hi> [by his word.] Not by a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, but by the written word. It is not an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate miſſion, but mediate, by the word. As Gods command in his word would be a mediate call to hear the word preached, to pray, to be baptized, to receive the Lords Supper, and to perform other Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, though no Presbyters ſhould exhort to theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo Chriſts command in the Goſpel, <hi>to goe and Preach,</hi>—is a mediate miſſion to all lawful Preachers, though no presbyters ſhould urge it upon them. And how a Presbytery can ſend, but by exhorting to follow this command of Chriſt, we know not. And in ſuch a Doctrinal way, for ought we ſee, a private Chriſtian may exhort to <hi>go and teach;</hi> yea, any Miniſter of Chriſt may ſay to another Miniſter, long after his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted an Officer, eſpecially in caſe of ſloath and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, <hi>Go and teach</hi> that people committed to thy charge.</p>
               <p>We finde Goſpel-commands directed by Chriſt unto Preachers, which have the nature and form of a miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go Diſciple all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſuch a miſſion belongeth to a Presbytery, let
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:120096:78"/>
them prove that can; we can find no ſillable of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof for it. And thus we have cleared the parts of this Deſcription of miſſion.</p>
               <p>And, if miſſion be taken in this ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 15 viz. For Chriſts commanding preachers to publiſh the Goſpel to ſuch perſons, and ſuch a people: Then a moral impoſſibility is intended by the interrogation; and it amounteth to thus much, How ſhall they ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, warrantably, or orderly preach, except they have a command from Chriſt to go? The Jews would have ingroſſed this priviledge; they laid claim to preaching as peculiar to them, and denyed that the Gentiles were commanded to be preached to. In anſwer poſſibly unto them, the Apoſtle may ſpeak thus: It is promiſed that in Goſpel-days the Gentiles ſhould believe; and they cannot believe without hearing, nor hear without preaching; nor can any warrantably preach to them, or ſo as to juſtifie their act, or expect a bleſſing from God, except they be ſent: <hi>i. e.</hi> except the Lord doth command to go and preach to them. If they muſt be preached to, it muſt be concluded that ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go to them with the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And if the words be taken in this ſenſe, the dint of many Objections is avoided, which are levelled againſt a bare providential ſending. We ſay, Providences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone do not expreſs the nature of miſſion; but there is a command of Chriſt alſo, to go and preach, wherein eſpecially this ſending doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. This ſending is not barely providential, but a miniſterial ſending, as appeareth by the next words: <hi>[As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel—]</hi> which words are taken out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52. and the Miniſters he ſpeaketh of, are called Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, verſ. 8. And the prophet himſelf is mentioned as one of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 The prophet declareth what acceptation
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:120096:79"/>
ſuch ſhould have amongſt the people, who brought good tidings, who publiſhed peace and ſalvation; but what miſſion they had, whether miniſterial, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, the prophet doth not there determine. To uſe their own ſimilitude: If a private perſon ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a pardon to a condemned malefactor, how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful would his feet be, though the ſame applied under the broad-Seal, by a perſon delegated from the Supream Magiſtrate, differeth from that.</p>
               <p>If perſons had onely a providential ſending, yet all this might be ſaid, How beautiful are their feet, when they bring good tidings of peace and ſalvation! But we aſſert that the King of Saints hath commanded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons gifted, to go and publiſh theſe good tidings; and this may make the news double welcome.</p>
               <p>2. It is promiſed, that their Watchmen ſhall lift up their voice and ſing, verſ. 8. But that all, who are ſaid to bring the good tidings, verſ. 7. are called Watchmen, verſ. 8. is not proved. Some think that by Watchmen there, are underſtood onely Apoſtles, and thoſe that were eye-witneſſes of what Chriſt did, and ſuffered for the redemption of ſinners; becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>[For they ſhall ſee eye to eye.—]</hi> which is like that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1.—<hi>Which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes.</hi>—and then there are more preachers ſpoken of ver. 7. then there are ver. 8.</p>
               <p>3. If all of them be called Watchmen, it is a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative term, taken from thoſe that ſtand in Watch-Towers, who foreſeeing dangers, forewarn of them; and foreſeeing approaching-mercies, give notice of them. And why gifted men may not do this, we know not, though Officers are put in truſt in an eſpecial manner to do it; in which reſpect (though all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel be Watchmen, yet) the term may be appropriated to Officers, in a ſpecial ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ojb.</hi> 2. If providential ſending were ſufficient,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:120096:79"/>
then women-preachers are as much ſent of God—yea, a tyrant, robber, or murtherer may juſtifie himſelf in his wickedneſs, as being ſent by God provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For women we have anſwered the Objection often.</p>
               <p>2. More then a providential ſending is aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> a command of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. The conſequence is feeble, to ſay, If a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſending be enough to allow a man to preach, then it may juſtifie men in ſtealing, murthering.—for preaching is a lawful work, but robbing and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering—are acts in themſelves ſinful. When by an ordering hand of providence, Chriſtians do meet together, they may exhort one another, and pray one with another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 13. But it will not follow, that they may rob and murther one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>3. They may be called Heralds, who preach the Goſpel, becauſe they uſually do publiſh it openly, as Heralds do their meſſages. Similitudes muſt not be ſtretched beyond the ſcope, nor be made to agree in all things. Let it be proved, that preachers are called Heralds, to connote their being authorized to publiſh the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>4. We apprehend that people are to be blamed for not hearing gifted men, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 21. If it be their duty to preach, then it is a peoples ſin, not to hear. As for <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 8. Chriſt aſſerts himſelf to be the true Shepherd, and the door by which men enter into life, and attain ſalvation. verſ. 9. <hi>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved.</hi>—And if he intendeth there to aſſert himſelf to be the door by which men muſt enter into the work of preaching, or any Office in the Church, gifted men enter in, by the door of his command. Chriſt ſaith, verſ. 5. <hi>And a ſtranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</hi> Such as preach falſe doctrine, or have wicked lives, are not of Chriſts flock, but are ſtrangers; and it is a vertue not to hear ſuch. And Chriſt ſaith, verſ. 7, 8. <hi>I am the door of the ſheep; all that ever came before me, are theeves, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but the ſheep did not hear them.</hi> All that in their teaching deny Chriſt to be the door, or who ſhew any other door to life and ſalvation beſides Chriſt, they are not to be heard. <hi>Ante Chriſtum venire, non est tempore Chriſtum praecedere, ſed aliam</hi>

                  <hi>quàm Chriſti Doctrinam docere.</hi> It may be expounded of thoſe which teach falſe Doctrine, and not of thoſe which enter without ſending.</p>
               <p>Here is mention made of miſſion, or of a Presbytery to give miſſion; and therefore it doth not prove, that it is a vertue not to hear ſuch as are not ſent by a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. Men might be blamed if it were but a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſending, as men are often for not hearing Gods voyce in other providences. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. And thus they may be called Heralds, becauſe they publiſh the Goſpel openly; and people may be blamed for not hearing, and yet no authoritative miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from a presbytery may be intended.</p>

               <p>And thus much concerning miſſion in the firſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word.</p>
               <p>2. Miſſion is a providential diſpoſing of Preachers, to ſuch perſons or ſuch a people, as Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or aſſigned the Goſpel to be publiſhed unto; or, ſending is a permitting them to go, a diſmiſſing them, that they may go: <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 26. when Chriſt had reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the blind man to ſight, <hi>he [ſent] him away to his houſe.

Paul.</hi>—Here ſending doth not denote the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of any power upon thoſe that are ſent, but only a diſmiſſing of them from the work they were about, to go to ſome other place. Sending is there little more then going, or the permitting men to go. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>God [ſent] me before you, to preſerve you a poſterity.</hi>—The Lord ordering by his providence <hi>Joſephs</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Egypt, is called his [ſending] of him, here is a providential ſending. And though other Scriptures ſpeak of ſending in that ſenſe we before ſpake of, yet we do not ſee that but ſending may be taken in this latter ſenſe, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>viz.</hi> for ſuch a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſending; and then the meaning is but this, <hi>How ſhall they preach to the Gentiles, if they do not go, or be not permitted, and by providence ordered to go where they are?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſcope of the place inclines us to theſe thoughts; for the Apoſtle is concluding, that there is no difference of nations in Goſpel-dayes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek.—ver.</hi> 13. <hi>For whoſoever</hi> (i. e. whether he be Jew or Gentile) <hi>ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here he aſſerteth the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and from thence he inferreth that Preachers of the Goſpel muſt be ſent unto them, becauſe as <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>They cannot call on the Lord without beleeving, nor cannot beleeve without hearing: they cannot hear without a Preacher; they cannot preach</hi> (i. e, to the Gentiles, for they are ſuch as had not heard of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.) <hi>except they be ſent,</hi> i. e. except by providence they be ordered to go amongſt them. The Jews grumbled at the going to preach unto the Gentiles: the Apoſtle proveth that they muſt be called, and therefore ſome muſt go preach to them. How ſhall they come by the glad tidings of the Goſpel, if none go to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? Alas they have no preachers amongſt themſelves, and how ſhall they hear, if none preach; and how ſhall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:120096:81"/>
they preach, if they do not go where they are to hear? now ſhall <hi>Paul</hi> preach to the nations of the Gentiles, if he be detained at, or doth not go from Jeruſalem?</p>
               <p>And all other interrogations, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a natural impoſſibility; it is naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a man to call on him, that he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on; and to beleeve on him, of whom he hath not heard; and to hear without a preacher, <hi>i. e.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one or other to publiſh what is to be heard: and that this onely ſhould be underſtood of a moral impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, <hi>[how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?]</hi> it is hard to conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Sending]</hi> in this ſenſe denoteth the ordering of a preacher for his bodily preſence, what place it ſhall be in, for preaching. This ſending may be iterated and repeated often. Thus God ſendeth, when by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he ordereth or diſpoſeth of things ſo, as there is a going to ſuch a place to preach. Thus Magiſtrates may ſend preachers to places that are deſtitute of the means of Grace; thus they ſent ſome Miniſters into <hi>Scotland,</hi> others into <hi>Ireland.</hi>—Thus a Church may ſend. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Then tidings of theſe things came unto the ears of [the Church] which was at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and they [ſent forth] Barnabas, that he ſhould go as far as</hi> Antioch, Here the Church ſent out a Preacher. Thus Presbyters may ſend men to preach. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>When the Apostles which were at Jeruſalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of</hi> God, <hi>they ſent unto them</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John. Thoſe that were ſent, were preachers before, had no authority to preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them by their miſſion; and if they had, then a Church may give authoritative miſſion; for the Church ſent <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 8. 14. And what is there more in this ſending, then a deſiring of him to go, or a diſmiſſing of him?</p>
               <p>And thus gifted men are capable of being ſent, as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:120096:82"/>
well as others, ſeeing there is no act of power about it And where there is no diſtance, there needeth not this miſſion by men: but how ſhould they preach to the Gentiles, who were at a diſtance, except they were ſent by thoſe Churches where now they preached? and if no more be intended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. it may eaſily be judged, what a poor argument that is, which many bring from that place, againſt the preaching of gifted men.</p>
               <p>And thus much in anſwer to their firſt argument: we ſhall be brief in anſwering the reſt.</p>

                  <hi>called of</hi> God, <hi>as</hi> Aaron.—No man ought to take the miniſterial honor upon him, unleſs called by God.</p>
               <p>This propoſition (ſay they) is not limited, but il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>Aaron,</hi> who undertook not this Office, till called thereunto. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 1. No more did any other of the Prieſts in the old Teſtament. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11. <hi>and</hi> 16. 16. If the Prieſts and Prophets of the Old Teſtament could not take this honor upon them till cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and appointed, who can ſhew any juſt reaſon, why any under the New Teſtament ſhould do otherwiſe?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:120096:82"/>
eſpecially, if we conſider that the Goſpel-Miniſtry is more weighty and glorious then the legal was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Chriſt, who though he be God bleſſed for ever, coequal and coeternal with the Father, yet he glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not himſelf, to be made an High-Prieſt, but was ſealed and inaugurated by his Father into this great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 54.—and thence they ſay, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be great preſumption for any man to glorifie himſelf, and make himſelf a Miniſter, before he be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordained thereunto.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here they run quite from the Queſtion they undertook to prove, <hi>[That none may aſſume the Office of the Miniſtry, unleſs he be ſolemnly ſet apàrt there unto.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And their concluſion from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 4, 5. is but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that no man ought to take it, unleſs called by God.</p>
               <p>If their argument be granted, yet their poſition is not proved by it. Gifted men may have a call of God to preach, and yet not be ſolemnly ſet apart. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were both called of God, yet they were not ſolemnly ſet apart by impoſition of hands with faſting and prayer; which is the ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part they intend, as themſelves expreſly declare.</p>
               <p>They are blaming gifted men in theſe words, <q>[Such intruders, as will neither <note place="margin">Jus Divinum Miniſterii, pag. 67.</note> be ſolemnly ſet apart for the Miniſtry by impoſition of hands, with faſting and prayer, nor give way to them that would.]</q> If to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and to be thus ſolemnly ſet apart, be all one, then neither <hi>Aaron</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> were called of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not thus ſet apart. If to be called of God, and to be ſo ſet apart, be different things, then their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is no proof of their poſition, which they would eſtabliſh by it. Here they take for granted what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by us, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a ſetting apart, is the only call
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:120096:83"/>
of God in Goſpel-dayes. Whereas Officers and gifted men, are called of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> allowed by him to preach; but neither of their cals doth conſiſt in ſuch a ſetting apart, though we grant a ſetting apart by faſting and prayer, to be neceſſary after a call to Office.</p>
               <p>2. We deny their general propoſition to have any footing in this Text. For, the <hi>[Honor]</hi> ſpoken of, and the univerſal note <hi>[no man]</hi> muſt neceſſarily be limited, according to the ſubject or matter inſiſted on. It is the rule they give us about the note of univerſality <hi>[all.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This univerſal <hi>all</hi> is to be reſtrained and limited, according to the ſubject or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſterii. pag.</hi> 95.</note> treated of. Now the ſubject ſpoken of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. is not the Miniſtry in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but onely one order of Miniſters, it is not a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſtry that is treated of, but a legal; it is not the whole Miniſtry of the Law, but one order of that Miniſtry, <hi>viz.</hi> Prieſts; it is not all under that order, but the higheſt, the chiefeſt under it; not Prieſts in general, but the High-Prieſt only, as appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>[every High-prieſt] taken from among men.—Aaron, ver.</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 5. So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made <hi>[an High-Prieſt.—]</hi> Neither is this High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt conſidered as performing a work which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with Miniſters of the Goſpel; he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as preaching the word, but as offering ſacrifices for ſin. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>That he may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſins.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 3.—<hi>To offer for ſins:</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>And no man taketh this honor unto himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far it is general, that no man taketh, or ought to take the honor to be a High prieſt to offer for ſins, but he that is called of God as was <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-prieſt.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, none may take the honor of the Higheſt Office under the Law, to be a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:120096:83"/>
High-prieſt, nor do the higheſt work of that Office, <hi>viz.</hi> offer for ſin; for any to ſay hence, that the Apoſtle makes this general propoſition, No man ought to take the miniſterial honor upon him unleſs called of God, is to conclude beyond the premiſes. For, there was that required unto the higheſt order of Officers, which is not requiſite unto Officers of an inferior ſpecies or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It were preſumption for any to undertake to be a high-prieſt to offer for ſins as Chriſt did without a call, The deſign of the Apoſtle, is to aſſert Chriſt to be the only high-prieſt, and that the ancient prieſt-hood muſt ceaſe, to give place unto him. To prove him to be a high-prieſt, he compareth him with the high-prieſts of the Law, and declareth that he was called of God, as well as they. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>And therefore remiſſion of ſin and ſalvation were to be expected by him.</hi> ver. 6, 9. but this cometh far ſhort of proving, that al Miniſters of the Goſpel are to be called of God, as was <hi>Aaron;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do not prefigure Chriſt as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, are not of ſuch a high order as high-prieſts were, nor do not expiate ſin as Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>3. As to their argument as drawn not from <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. but from the prieſts and prophets in general of the Old Teſtament, it proveth not (if granted) a ſolemn ſetting apart by faſting and prayer and impoſition of hands, but only a call to be neceſſary: and then the queſtion between us, is only this, What that call in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel dayes is? We conclude that Chriſts command or allowance, is a ſufficient call; and if gifted men had not this, we grant they ought not to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The third Argument is, from the titles that are given to the Miniſters of the Goſpel: they are called <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Stewards,</hi> Tit. 1. 7. <hi>Men of God,</hi> Tim. 6. 11. <hi>compared with</hi> 2 King. 5. 8. <hi>watchmen,</hi> Ezek. 3. 7. <hi>Angels,</hi> Rev. 2. 1. which are all names of Office, and require a ſpecial deſignation from
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:120096:84"/>
God.—And theſe titles are applyed not onely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, but to ordinary Miniſters. Other titles they mention: Miniſters are called Gods mouth.—Good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt—Gods ſervants and Miniſters.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some of theſe titles cannot groundedly be reſtrained to preachers. For all Chriſtians are Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Jeſus Chriſt, have ſpiritual armour, and are commanded to uſe it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 10, 11. <hi>Finally my brethren be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; put on the whole armour of God.</hi>—1 Theſ. 5. 8. <hi>Let us who are of the day, be ſober, putting on the breſtplate of faith.</hi>—All believers, all who are of the day, are commanded to be good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be preachers, (if that title be peculiar to preachers) which is more then we aſſert. All believers are Gods ſervants; <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth them to be, as the ſervants of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. and they are believers in general he ſpeaketh to, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22.—<hi>Being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God.</hi>—All who enjoy freedom from ſin, are Gods ſervants. Thoſe that are allowed by the Lord to declare his will to others, are Gods mouth, though it be but in a way of private admonition.</p>
               <p>To be men of God, is to be his ſervants. And in a general ſenſe, gifted men are Embaſſadors and Angels; which ſignifie, Meſſengers, or men ſent. We have proved before, that gifted men are ſent. They have a command and allowance from Chriſt to go and preach, and are providentially ſent alſo.</p>
               <p>2. If thoſe titles muſt be taken in a ſpecial ſenſe, and be applyed to Officers onely, yet ſtill it doth not prove their poſition, that they muſt be ſet apart by faſting and prayer, and impoſition of hands. Their deſignation may be by other acts.</p>
               <p>Neither do they deny that men may preach by gift,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:120096:84"/>
without ſuch a ſpecial deſignation.</p>
               <p>3. If they be taken in that ſpecial ſenſe, then thoſe titles neceſſarily import a ſpecial relation between the perſons to whom thoſe titles are given, and ſome Church of Chriſt: as, they are Angels of the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Unto the Angel of the Church of Epheſus.</hi>—ver. 8, 12, 18. &amp; 3, 1, 7, 14.</p>
               <p>So, they are Stewards; which do not onely denote their having a warrant to Officiate, but alſo their being over the houſhold, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 42, <hi>Who then is that faithful and wiſe Steward, whom his Lord ſhall make ruler over his houſhold?</hi> They have ſome houſe or Church of God, which they are Stewards over.</p>
               <p>Watchmen, Embaſſadors, Biſhops, have ſome Churches or other committed to their charge, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn of dangers, and to do their meſſage to, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee: ſo as they ſhould break their truths, if they ſhould not forewarn thoſe Churches, or not do their meſſage to thoſe Churches, or not overſee thoſe flocks, as well as if they did neglect theſe works altogether. As a Father ſhould break the truſt of that relation, if he ſhould not teach, govern, and provide for his own Children, though he ſhould keep a School, and there teach and govern many other Children.</p>
               <p>And ſuch a relation, ſuch a truſt or charge gifted men aſſume not; and therefore this Argument ſtriketh not at them, if the titles be taken in ſuch a ſenſe: and if in a larger ſenſe, then gifted Brethren are as capable of thoſe titles as others. Embaſſadors are not onely betruſted with a meſſage, but limited by their commiſſion, what Princes or forrain States to treat with; and if they go to other Princes or States, they cannot treat with them as Embaſſadors, though they may report their Maſters willingneſs to hold a good correſpondency with them alſo.</p>
               <p>But if they ſhould not go to thoſe they are by their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:120096:85"/>
commiſſion ſent unto, they ſhould break their truſt: and ſo for Stewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Our Brethren argue, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſtinction that is made in Scripture, between gifts and calling: we read, (ſay they) <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. Firſt Chriſt gives his Apoſtles their commiſſion, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you:</hi> then he gives them their gifts, <hi>Receive the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 9. God touched his lips with a coal from the Alter, and gifted him; and afterwards he gives him his commiſſion. Thus alſo it was with the prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5, 9. God ſends him, and then puts forth his hand, toucheth his mouth, and fits him. Even as it is in all civil governments, gifts make not any man a Judge, or a Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is in Church-affairs; it is not gifts, but calling, that conſtitutes a Miniſter; therefore that diſtinction of a Miniſter by gifts, and a Miniſter by calling, hath no footing in the word of truth.—Then women might preach as well as men, for they may have as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent gifts.—If he <hi>(i. e.</hi> a perſon gifted) take the Office upon him unſent, he is an uſurper, and may fear to periſh in the gainſaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> notwitſtanding his gifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Argument is like the former; it doth not prove their poſition, if it be granted: for, though gifts and calling &amp; ſending be diſtinguiſhed, yet it doth not follow, that none may aſſume Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, unleſs he be ſolemnly ſet apart thereunto: for calling and ſending are not the ſame with ſetting apart; which ſtill they ſuppoſe as granted.</p>
               <p>2. The Scriptures alledged, ſpeak of ſending, not of ſetting apart, as diſtinguiſhed from gifting; and of the ſending of ſuch as were Officers before, not of any ſending, that made or conſtituted them Officers: for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:120096:85"/>
you:</hi> i. e. as my Father hath ſent me to make peace for ſome in all Nations, ſo <hi>(Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) ſend I you into all Nations to publiſh and declare this peace which is made: this was ſpoken to the Apoſtles after Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24. and therefore this ſending which is diſtinguiſhed from gifting of them, did not make them preachers or Officers; for they were conſtituted preachers long before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. They had preaching gifts before; but here was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Spirit in a fuller meaſure.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a prophet before; and therefore this miſſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 9. did not make him a prophet, but put him upon the work of propheſying, which he was called to before.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is firſt ordained to be a prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Before thou cameſt forth out of the womb,</hi> I <hi>ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, and</hi> I <hi>ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations.</hi> Jeremiah excuſeth himſelf, v. 6. I <hi>am a child.</hi> The Lord ſilenceth him in his excuſes, <hi>v.</hi> 7.—<hi>Say-not, I am a child, for thou ſhalt go to all that I ſhall ſend thee.</hi>—</p>
               <p>He was ſanctified and deſtinated to be a prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his excuſes, yet not ſent till afterward; it is ſaid, <hi>To all that I [ſhall] ſend thee to.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. He toucheth his mouth, and fits him. And it is like his miſſion is expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. However it doth not appear, that his ſending, did conſtitute him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>So that theſe Scriptures alledged, ſpeak not againſt aſſuming an Office, without being called and ordained; but againſt Officers going to a people which they are not ſent as yet by the Lord unto. Men lawfully called and ordained unto Office-work, may erre this way, as well as gifted men.</p>
               <p>3. Their inſtances from civil Governments, might have been ſpared: as gifts makes not any man a Judg, a Lord Mayor, Sheriff,—ſo we grant in Church-affairs,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:120096:86"/>
that gifts alone do not make a man a Church-Officer, for then there were no preaching <hi>ex dono</hi> at all. We have proved, that gifted men have a Call to exerciſe their gifts; and therefore preaching <hi>ex Officio &amp; ex do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> hath footing in the word. It is not ſo proper to ſay, A Miniſter by Gift, and a Miniſter by Calling: Gifts do not give being to the Call, it is the written word doth that: yet becauſe gifts are a ſigne to judge by, an evidence who have a Divine allowance to preach, therefore we diſtinguiſh between preaching by Office, and by Gift. Such viſible believers, as are really gifted (if they have not forfeited their liberty by a corrupt life or doctrine, which Officers may do as well as others) by the word of God they have allowance to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corahs</hi> aſſuming the Office of the High Prieſt, which did belong to <hi>Aaron;</hi> and that without a Call, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 10. ſpeaketh nothing againſt the preaching of gifted men, who aſſume not Office, and have a Call to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. They argue from the Rules laid down in Scripture, for the Calling of men to the Office of the Miniſtry: The word of God (ſay they) doth exactly tell us the qualifications of the perſon that is to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3, &amp;c. The Scripture alſo directs for the manner of his calling to the work, who are to ordain, how he is to be ordained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14, &amp;c. Now either theſe directions are ſuperfluous and unneceſſary, or elſe it is a truth, that no man ought to take this Office up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him without ſuch a Call. Nor were theſe directions given for that age onely, but for all the ages of the Church to the end of the world; as appears evidently from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. compared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 7, 21. In the firſt place, he is charged to keep thoſe commands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, to the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt: In the ſecond place, there is a ſolemn charge—and one
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:120096:86"/>
main ground why <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful—was, that thereby falſe doctrine might be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3, 4.—The ſame charge upon the ſame ground is laid upon <hi>Titus, Chap.</hi> 1. 5, 9, 10.—which <hi>(ſoil.</hi> directions) are all ain and unuſeful, if any may enter upon the Miniſtry without Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Argument doth onely prove, that all who aſſume the Office of a Biſhop, or Elder, they ought to be ordained. Thoſe that the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, are ſuch, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1.—<hi>If a man deſireth [the Office of a Biſhop</hi>—1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>Let [the Elders] that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour.</hi>—Tit. 1. ver. 5. <hi>Ordain Elders,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 7. <hi>For a Biſhop,</hi> i. e. an Overſeer, muſt be blameleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe directions were ſuperfluous, if none were ſo to be ordained.</p>
               <p>2. We grant it is a choice means for the preventing and ſuppreſſing of falſe doctrines, to look that thoſe Goſpel-qualifications which are required to be in Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, be found in men before they be admitted into Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: for if the Paſtors be not ſound in the faith, they will be like to lead the flock into error, and will not ſeek to convince others who are gainſayers.</p>
               <p>3 But yet we do not find that the Rules laid down in thoſe Scriptures about Ordination, have the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſe doctrines as their main ground: as for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. The Apoſtle beſought <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that he might charge ſome [that they teach no other doctrine.] He doth not bid him charge them not to preach at all, nor charge them not to preach without Ordination; but not to preach any doctrines contrary to the Goſpel. And in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. he chargeth; that he that be taken into the Office of an Elder, ſhould hold faſt the faithful word, verſ. 9. <hi>That he may be able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gain-ſayers. For there are many unruly and vain talkers.</hi>—Verſ. 11. <hi>Whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:120096:87"/>
He would have Elders able and ſound in the faith, that by ſound doctrine they may ſilence gainſayers; but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is a means unto this, not Ordination onely. The Church ought to be careful that ſuch be choſen into Office, as are able and faithful.</p>
               <p>4. Neither do we finde in any of the places alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Ordination is made the Call to the work of preaching, nor yet the Call to Office: Our Brethren ſtill ſuppoſe that Ordination is the Call to both; which we deny.</p>
               <p>This Argument ſpeaketh not againſt the preaching of gifted Brethren without Ordination; for they lay no claim to the Office of an Elder, or Overſeer; and ſuch onely are required there to be ordained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. They argue from that confuſion which would come into the Church, if every man that preſumes himſelf gifted, ſhould intrude <note place="margin">Jus Divin.</note> himſelf into the Office of the Miniſtry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a regular Call:—the reaſon (they ſay) is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; the proſtituting of this ſacred and weighty Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the wills of men, opens a door to all diſorders, and the introducing of all hereſies and errours: how much did the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſuffer from ſuch as came from the Apoſtles, and had no commiſſion! <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5. Beſides that contempt and ſcrone which it expoſeth the miniſtry unto: admit the ſame in the Commonwealth, or in an Army; might he that would make himſelf a Mayor, Judge, Conſtable, a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, Chaptain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What an Iliad of miſeries would thence enſue, is eaſier to be imagined, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is quite beſides the Queſtion; for, we do not aſſert that every man that preſumes himſelf gifted, may aſſume the Office of the Miniſtry, nor that he may preach; much leſs do we ſay, That he may do either without a regular Call: but we ſay,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:120096:87"/>
That ſuch believers as are really gifted, (not barely who preſume themſelves ſo to be) they have a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Call to preach; and this doth not proſtitute either the Office or the work unto the wills of men, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a door to diſorders—it being the declared will of Chriſt, that ſuch ſhould preach.</p>
               <p>2. We grant, that to a mans exerciſe of his gifts in this or that place, there is prerequired a Call from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or the Magiſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuch a Call is ſufficient to prevent all thoſe miſeries that they ſuppoſe would enſue upon ſuch a practiſe in a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>3. The inſtances are about Officers; as, to be a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, Judge, Conſtable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be an Officer: we plead onely for exerciſe of gifts.</p>
               <p>4. It is not ſaid, That the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the preaching of men without a commiſſion, nor without Ordination; but by their preaching falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Certain which went out from us, have troubled you with words, ſubverting your ſouls, ſaying, Ye muſt be circumciſed, and keep the Law: to whom we gave no ſuch commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had no commiſſion to preach, that they muſt be circumciſed—but it is not ſaid, They had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Paul</hi> would not circumciſe <hi>Titus</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the falſe Brethren, in yeilding the leaſt ſubjection to them, that the doctrine of the Goſpel might be preſerved pure, without legal mixtures amongſt the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi> for they would have made an ill uſe of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to preſs ſuch ceremonies upon them, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to Salvation, or to perſecute thoſe that uſed them not,—and ſo Chriſtian-liberty had been betrayed, if <hi>Titus</hi> had been circumciſed; but how this ſpeaketh againſt the preaching of true Brethren who are gifted, we know not. Though falſe Brethren have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach falſe doctrines, yet true <hi>Nathaneels,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:120096:88"/>
who are gifted, may preach the pure doctrines of the Goſpel, and nothing here ſpoken, will reflect upon them therein. Theſe are not here blamed for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a commiſſion, but for preaching falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>5. That confuſion they ſpeak of, will not be at all avoided by making Ordination the only door into the Miniſtry: for ſuch as preſume themſelves ſo qualified, that they ought to be ordained, if they be denyed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, yet they will count it their duty to preach without it, when they cannot have it: and ſo the door is opened as wide to all diſorders, and the introducing of all hereſies and errors in the way of Ordination, as in the way of the preaching of gifted Brethren; and how will our Brethren ſhut this door, or hinder theſe evils? either it muſt be by Church-cenſures, or by the civil Magiſtrate, that the mouths of unordained men muſt be ſtopped, if Ordination onely giveth power to preach; and both theſe ways are as open to ſtop the mouths of ungifted men, (where the caſe juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth ſuch proceedings) if it be aſſerted that gifted men are empowred to preach.</p>
               <p>And thus we have anſwered their Arguments, to prove their firſt Poſition.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Anſwering ſuch Arguments as are brought to prove, that none may do the work of the Miniſtry, without Ordination.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are ſeveral diſtinctions which our Brethren premiſe before they come to their arguments, and theſe we have ſpoken to before. They ſay <hi>(Jus Div. Min. p.</hi> 78.) <q>[It is Authoritative teaching only which we deny.]</q> If by authoritative they mean the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Office-wiſe, or ſuch preaching wherein Office-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is put forth, we might grant all their Arguments, and yet nothing is gained againſt the preaching of gifted men.</p>
               <p>But becauſe their poſition and ſome of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeem to reach further, and to deny all ordinary preaching without Ordination; therefore we ſhall give a reply to ſuch arguments as ſeem to have the greateſt ſtrength in them: their poſition is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſition.</hi> That none may do the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, without Ordination. <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 78. That none may undertake the work of the Miniſtry, but he that is ſolemnly ſet apart thereunto. <hi>Jus Divin. Min. pag.</hi> 80.</p>
               <p>Their Arguments to prove this, are eight in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. That work for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of his own, neither ought nor may be performed by any that are not deſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Office. But God hath deſigned ſpecial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his own, for the preaching of his word. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:120096:89"/>
none ought or may preach the word, but ſuch as are deſigned unto this Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their Minor we grant, if they intend no more in it, then they intimate in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. We acknowledge that preaching of the word is one work aſſigned unto Officers. It is not their only work, yet it is one ſpecial work which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to perform.</p>
               <p>But their Major we deny: and we ſay, That a work for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of his own, may be performed by ſome that are not deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto that Office. As for example, <hi>Act. 6. 4. But we will give our ſelves continually to prayer, and to the Miniſtery of the word.</hi> Here prayer is declared to be a ſpecial work of Officers, as well as the Miniſtery of the word; the Apoſtles would have Deacons appointed, that they might be freed from worldly incumbrances, and might give themſelves continually, not only to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo to prayer; and therefore prayer is a work for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his own. So <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 36. Yet prayer may be performed by ſuch as are not deſigned unto Office. It is the duty of every Chriſtian to be exerciſed in the work of prayer. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing:</hi> and this is injoyned the Saints in general, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>We exhort you brethren.</hi> Jam. 5. 13. <hi>Is any among you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted? let him pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo to diſtribute worldly goods is one work, for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of own, <hi>viz.</hi> Deacons. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 34, 35. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet it is the duty of ſuch as are not deſigned unto that Office, to diſtribute to the neceſſities of others. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Diſtributing to the neceſſity of the Saints.</hi>—and this is put in the midſt of Chriſtian duties: <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Such as are <hi>to rejoyce in hope, and be patient in tribulation, and continue inſtant in prayer,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:120096:89"/>
are alſo to diſtribute.</hi>—and therefore it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to Officers. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 13.</p>
               <p>Alſo exhorting, and reproving or rebuking, are works for the doing of which, God hath deſigned ſpecial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his own. The Apoſtle layeth down the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a Biſhop or Elder, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. and one work of his is, to exhort and convince gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, and-rebuke with all authority.</hi> Yet theſe works may warrantably be performed by ſome that are not deſigned unto that Office. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Exhort one another dayly.</hi>—and 10. 25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But though private Chriſtians may doe thoſe works in the matter of them, which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Officers to, as privately pray, diſtribute, exhort, rebuke;—yet they may not do theſe in the ſameway and manner, that Officers are to perform them in; not publickly, or with all authority.</p>
               <p>The fuller anſwer to this objection is given before; yet we will add thus much:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If an Officer exhorteth or rebuketh ſuch as he is over in the Lord in private, will not this be deemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner of act, then if a brother doth it, who is no Officer? If ſo, then the publickneſs of an act, is not neceſſary to make it an act of Office.</p>
               <p>2. If it be the different way and manner of acting, that maketh any act to be an act of Office; then our Brethrens argument halteth: for that is drawn from the work it ſelf, not from the manner of working. Let them put their argument into that form, and then it muſt run thus:</p>
               <p>That work for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of his own, neither ought nor may be performed in that ſame way and manner which Officers act in, by any that are not deſigned to that Office. But God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of his own for the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:120096:90"/>
preaching of the word. Therefore none ought or may preach the word in the ſame way and manner that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers doe, but ſuch as are deſigned unto this Office.</p>
               <p>And if they will put the argument into this form, we may grant the whole, and yet gifted men may preach the word without croſſing of it; for they do it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way and manner, not under ſuch a relation to thoſe they preach to, as Officers are.</p>
               <p>And although this Anſwer might be ſufficient to the Argument, yet we ſhall take away their grounds for their Major.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. God hath ſeverely puniſhed ſuch as have done the work appointed by him to ſpecial Officers, though they had no intent to invade the Office unto which that work was by God deſigned:—<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he loſt his Kingdom for offering ſacrifice, though but once, and that in a great ſtraight.—<hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 9, 10. who put his hand to the Ark, and that out of a good intention to keep it from falling, when the oxen ſhook it; and yet the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt him, &amp; he ſmote him that he died.—<hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18.—<hi>went into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord to burn incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe.</hi>—and though he was a King, <hi>yet the Lord ſmote him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with the plague of Leproſie, of which he was not heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Objection concludeth as much, or is equally ſtrong againſt the preaching of any who are not Officers, be the neceſſity never ſo great, and the caſe never ſo extraordinary; and ſo is againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as againſt us: for they grant <hi>(Jus Div. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 80.) that in caſes of neceſſity, men out of Office may preach; and inſtance in <hi>Aedeſius</hi> and <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentius</hi> two private men, by whoſe means the Indians were converted to the Chriſtian faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> was extraordinary, the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:120096:90"/>
were ready to aſſault him, he had not made his peace with God, <hi>Samuel</hi> delayed his coming, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to ſcatter from him; <hi>whereupon he conſtrained himſelf, and offered a ſacrifice:</hi> all theſe things our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren reckon up, <hi>(Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 81.) and then call it a neceſſitated act.</p>
               <p>So in the caſe of <hi>Uzza,</hi> what greater neceſſity could there be then this, when the Ark was in danger, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>The oxen ſhook it.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 9, 10. <hi>The oxen ſtumbled.</hi> If the Ark had fallen or had been broken, how exceedingly Iſrael had ſuffered by it, the uſe of it will evidence, and that dolefull complaint, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>The Ark of the Lord is taken.</hi> and ver. 22.—<hi>The glory is departed from Iſrael, for the Ark of God is taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either our Brethren muſt ſay, That none may preach in a caſe of neceſſity without Ordination, or being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to Office, and ſo croſs themſelves; and that none muſt preach as probationers, (for that is deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Office) but they muſt ordain men before they hear them preach, and ſo before they know their fitneſs to preach; or elſe they muſt grant, that theſe examples of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Uzza,</hi> are impertinent, and no proofs of the Argument. Let them prove that theſe acts might be performed (ſo much as once) by any before they were actually in ſuch Offices as the works did belong to, upon any account whatever.</p>
               <p>2. Theſe acts were expreſly forbidden, and ſome of them threatned with death to any perſon that did them, beſides the Officers deſigned for the doing of them; as <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. <hi>ver</hi> 15. <hi>The Sons of Kohath ſhall come to bear it, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t touch any holy thing, leſt they dy.</hi>—They are forbidden ſo much as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any of the holy things, upon pain of death; <hi>Uzzah</hi> breaking ſuch a command, he ſuffered the penalty, was puniſhed with death. So <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. <hi>ver,</hi> 40. <hi>That no

ſtranger, which is not of the ſeed of Aaron, come neer to offer incenſe before the Lord, that he be not as</hi> Korah <hi>and his company, &amp;c.</hi> All Iſraelites or Levites (ſave <hi>Aarons</hi> ſons only) are counted ſtrangets in this caſe of Prieſt-hood. None might Offer incenſe <note place="margin">Ainſw.</note> but they, leſt they be as <hi>Korah,</hi> in ſin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 51. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 22, 23. <hi>Neither muſt the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>henceforth come nigh the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, leſt they bear ſin, and dy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let any ſhew where the preaching of gifted Brethren is thus forbidden, elſe theſe examples are nothing to their purpoſe. And beſides, the matter of theſe works, as well as the manner of performing them, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to any but thoſe Officers; whereas the matter of this work of preaching is allowed undenyably to ſuch as are no Officers: they may exhort and reprove pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, by our Brethrens own grant; but might not privately burn incenſe, or offer ſacrifice:—which ſheweth a further difference between thoſe acts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. This practiſe doth make voyd, or at beſt unneceſſary and inſufficient, thoſe Officers which God hath appointed. What needs a peculiar Officer to be ſet apart to a common work?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is common but to ſuch as are gifted, not to all Chriſtians, as they ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>2. It is not performed in the ſame manner by gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, or under ſuch a relation, as in caſe of Office it is: Officers preach to their Churches, as to thoſe that they are over in the Lord, &amp; that are committed to their charge for ſuch ends; but gifted men ſtand not under any ſuch relation to thoſe they preach unto. Some Churches have no Officers; and thoſe that have, yet need the gifts of other Members. In ſome places there are no Churches to be Officers to, the people having never had the Goſpel preached to them. It will hardly be proved, that Officers muſt leave their Churches, to preach to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:120096:91"/>
theſe; and if not, they muſt either finde ſome Officers who have no Churches, which is to finde a ſhepherd without a flock, a relate without a correlate; or elſe they muſt ſay, that none muſt preach for the converſion of ſuch, or elſe that men not in Office may preach: and this doth not make Officers either voyd, unneceſſary or inſufficient. Officers are neceſſary and ſufficient to the end that Chriſt hath appointed them unto, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and take charge of his Churches under him; but they are not ſufficient to undertake the whole worke of preaching in all places and to all perſons.</p>
               <p>3. This Objection lyeth as ſtrongly againſt Officers being deſigned to admoniſh, exhort, or reprove, at leaſt in private; for what need a peculiar Officer to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part (ſay they) to a common work? other Chriſtians may exhort and reprove; and will our Brethren ſay, therefore there is no need, that Officers ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to this work?</p>
               <p>

This practiſe doth confound &amp; diſturb that order which God hath ſet in his Church, therefore it muſt needs be ſinful: <hi>God is the God of order, and not of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. and hath commanded that every one ſhould do his own work, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in his own calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. he hath condemned thoſe that walk diſorderly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. and are buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: he hath placed in his Church different orders, ſome ſhepherds, ſome ſheep; ſome Teachers of the word, ſome to be taught: as their places, ſo their works are diſtinct.—This takes away the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between ſhepherds and flock, Paſtor and people, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We have proved that the preaching of gifted Brethren is a part of that order which Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, &amp; therefore doth neither confound nor diſturb that order which God hath ſet in his Church. If Chriſt hath allowed their preaching, then it is their work, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:120096:92"/>
in doing of it, they walk orderly. We have ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it doth belong to their place and calling to preach: and thither we refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>2. The preaching of perſons not deſigned to Office, doth not take away the diſtinction between ſhepherds, and flock; Teachers, and ſome Taught:—becauſe they do not act under ſuch a relation towards them as Officers do.</p>
               <p>A Father may reach and inſtruct his children as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another man may inſtruct and teach the ſame children as a School-maſter; yet theſe relations are not deſtroyed or confounded hereby, though both doe the ſame work. Here are Fatherly teachings, and yet the diſtinction between the Maſter and Scolar is not taken away: and the ſame may be ſaid, if a friend Teacheth them, who ſtands in no ſuch relation to them. It is a common practice in Schools for ſome youths of ripe wits and wel learned, by the appointment of the School-maſter to be often ſet to teach fellow-ſcholars; and yet the diſtinction between School-maſter and Scholars, is not taken away hereby, he remaineth School-maſter ſtill to thoſe youths who teach others in the School. So gifted men are by Chriſts appointment to teach others, and yet the diſtinction between Shepherd and flock, Paſtor and people,—is not taken away hereby; the Officer of ſuch a Church, where ſuch gifted men are, doth remain a ſhepherd, a paſtor, or Teacher ſtill, even to thoſe gifted men who teach others.</p>
               <p>3. If you will take paſtor, ſhepherd or teacher, not for the relation, or ſuch as take charge of a flock, a people, a Church, for feeding and teaching, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that doe feed or inſtruct others; yet in that ſenſe will not the diſtinction betweene ſhepherd and flock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be taken away; for there are many in a Church, that are not gifted to teach others; and they and the women are fed, are taught. Yea, thoſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:120096:92"/>
who themſelves are teachers, yet in that general ſenſe are properly ſaid to be taught, when they hear others preach: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>Ye may all propheſie one by one, that [all] may [learn] and [all] may be [comforted.]</hi> All the prophets when they hear, they are Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>And thus we have anſwered their firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No Religious ſervice may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Argum. 2. Jus Divin. Min. p. 85.</note> unto God by any other ſort of perſons then ſuch as are appointed or otherwiſe warranted thereunto. The preaching of the word is a religious ſervice unto which perſons gifted, not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, are neither appointed nor warranted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preaching of the word may not be performed by gifted perſons un-ordained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny their minor, and we aſſert, That perſons gifted, not ordained, are appointed or warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. They are not appointed; for then every gifted man that preacheth not, is guilty of the ſin of omiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. So he is guilty of the ſin of omiſſion, if an opportunity hath been offered, and he will not preach. If no door be regularly opened for men gifted or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, to exerciſe their gifts, then it is no ſin of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>2. He is guilty of the ſin of omiſſion, if he doth not preach at all, if ſcuh an opportunity be offered; but he may not be guilty of the ſin of omiſſion for not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this place or that time: as the want of a call from others to exerciſe his gifts, may free it from being a ſin of omiſſion; ſo there may be ſomething that may juſtly hinder the perſon gifted from accepting of a call to preach in ſuch a place, or at ſuch a time; as ſickneſs may diſable, and other natural cauſes: ſo upon moral accounts, either men gifted or ordained may lawfully
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:120096:93"/>
refuſe to preach, to ſome people at ſome times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Then preaching muſt be looked upon as a common duty, enjoyned unto all believers, as ſuch: and every one ſhould ſtudy Divinity in order to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and wo to him that preaches not, though he could preach but one Sermon onely, and doth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If they intend this of being immediately under an injunction to preach; there is no ſhadow of reaſon for the conſequence. To ſay, if all gifted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to preach, then all believers are to preach, as ſuch, we deny it; for, many believers are not gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it is enjoyned onely to gifted believers.</p>
               <p>2. If they intend it of a mediate injunction, that believers, as ſuch, are enjoyned to ſeek for ſuch gifts as they may be able to teach others, we ſee no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in that: for the Apoſtle exhorts the Brethren in general of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to covet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5, 39. And the Apoſtle blameth the Hebrews in general, thus: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you.</hi>—</p>
               <p>3. The Apoſtle was undoubtedly ad Officer, and ſaith it of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Wo is unto me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> And therefore this concludeth no further then Officers; or if it doth reach further, it is onely as we have expreſſed under the former Objection about its being a ſin of Omiſſion not to preach.</p>
               <p>4. We deny that ſuch a man is gifted who is able to make but one Sermon in his life-time. We ask our Brethren, whether they would deem a man gifted to preach, and ſo durſt ordain him, if he could make but one Sermon?</p>
               <p>To prove their Minor further, that gifted perſons are not warranted to preach, they tell us that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word is founded in inſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be regulated according to it: and tell us, That
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:120096:93"/>
for the publick exerciſe of gifts by thoſe who are no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they find no inſtitution, and refer to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to Objections.</p>
               <p>And in anſwer to this, we refer the Reader to our foregoing reaſons, which prove an inſtitution for it.</p>
               <p>If no man may do the work of the Magiſtrate in the Civil, or of a Deacon in the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſſical <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. <hi>Jus Div. Min. p.</hi> 86</note> ſtate, but he that is called to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Magiſtrate, or of a Deacon; then much leſs may any man preach the word (which is the work of a Miniſter) but he that is called to the Office of the miniſtry. But no man may do the work of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the Civil, or a Deacon in the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate, but he that is called to the Office of a magiſtrate, or of a Deacon: therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This argument holdeth as ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preaching of any as probationers, as it doth againſt other gifted men. Our Brethren hold forth this as their own principle and practice, that men may preach for tryal ſeveral times, before they be ordained; and indeed how could it be known that they were apt to teach, if they never made tryal? no man may doe ſo much as one particular act that belongeth to a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, unleſs he be called to the Office of a magiſtrate: it was but one particular act that was deſired. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. If this argument therefore be valid, they muſt not preach ſo much as one ſermon as probationers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ordained to Office.</p>
               <p>2. Both propoſitions may be denyed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Major or conſequence will not hold good. Though no man might do the work of a magiſtrate, or of a Decon, but he that is called to ſuch Offices; yet a man may preach the word (which is one work of a Miniſter) who is not called to the Office of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:120096:94"/>
Becauſe the work of a magiſtrate is peculiar to, and doth neceſſarily imply and preſuppoſe the Office of a magiſtrate; but preaching the word doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preſuppoſe or imply the Office of the miniſtry. Preaching is one work which miniſters in Office do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; but it is not ſo peculiar to Office, as the work of a Magiſtrate is. As for example, Prayer is one work of a Miniſter. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>But we will give our ſelves continually [to prayer] and to the miniſtry of the word.</hi> Their argument is as forcible againſt gifted mens pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or giving themſelves to prayer, as againſt their preaching; thus: if no man may do the work of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the civil, or of a Deacon in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtate, but he that is called to the Office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or of a Deacon; then much leſs may any man give himſelf to prayer (which is a work of a Miniſter) but he that is called to the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p>But will our Brethren ſay, that no man may pray, or give himſelf to prayer, but he that is in Office? yet prayer is a work that Officers perform as well as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If they ſay, that prayer is not peculiar to Office; we ſay, no more is preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The reaſon of the connexion is evident; for by how much the work of the miniſtry is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, difficulty, and danger then either of theſe, by ſo much the greater care and circumſpection is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that it be not performed promiſcuouſly.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not make the conſequence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this care and circumſpection may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and yet men who are allowed to preach, may not be called to Office: a man may have approbation, and yet not have Ordination. If we ſhould grant that none might preach until they be approved, and upon tryal
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:120096:94"/>
be found to have thoſe qualifications, which by Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules preachers ought to have; yet how will it follow none may preach, unleſs they be called and to Office</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe men may warrantably perform ſome works of greater conſequence, difficulty and danger, who yet may not perform works of leſs conſequence and importance: as for example, every Chriſtian may beleeve, and exerciſe himſelf to meditation of the word; which are works of higher conſequence, becauſe the ſalvation of the ſoul is ſo neerly concerned in them; and yet every Chriſtian may not doe the work of Magiſtrates or Deacons, which are of an inferior nature, relating more to the good of the Body. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it help to ſay, that mediatating and beleeving are not acts of Office, unleſs they can prove, that preaching is an incommunicable act of Office: the example is brought only to ſhew, that God doth not allow ſome works of an inferior nature to be done by men unappointed to Office, and yet doth approve of their adventuring on works of higher conſequence, difficulty and danger, without their being called to Office.</p>
               <p>If the Lord hath warranted by his word, and allowed gifted men to preach without a call to Office, then they may do it, though it be a work of higher conſequence then the work of a Magiſtrate, which they may not do without a call to the Office of a Magiſtrate. We know not any that plead for preaching without a Commiſſion; but we ſay, a written word is Commiſſion enough to preach without ordination to Office. The Lord can li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a leſſer work to Office, and not ſo limit a greater work; and what is man, that he ſhould gainſay it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Minor may be denyed in part; For, ſome men may doe the work which a Deacon doth, who is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:120096:95"/>
not called to the Office of a Deacon: diſtributing to the neceſſities of the Saints is a work of a Deacon, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and yet (as we ſhewed in the anſwer to their firſt argument) men out of Office may diſtribute for the ſame end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13. We do not think, but that if a man hath ability, he may lawfully diſtribute of his own goods, to all thoſe Church-members that are in want, though he be no Deacon by Office; yea, he may diſtribute to the ſame perſons, the ſame quantity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet no Deacon, that afterward he doth being a Deacon, and yet may not be blame-worthy; and why may not a man as lawfully preach, and that to all thoſe perſons, being as yet no Officer to them, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he preacheth as an Officer to?</p>
               <p>Therefore, if by doing the work of Magiſtrates, or Deacons, they mean barely a doing the ſame work that they do, and do not intend it of acts peculiar to their offices; then their Minor is denyed: ſome men may lawfully do ſuch works, who are not called to be Magiſtrates or Deacons. But if by doing the work of a Magiſtrate, they mean, a work peculiar to a Magiſtrate; and by the work of a Deacon, a doing of it as under ſuch a relation to the Church, or in ſuch a manner as Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons by their office are to do it; then we grant their Minor: none may do works peculiar to a Magiſtrate, or take the overſight of the Churches treaſure, or call for, receive and diſpoſe of the Churches goods, as one that is a truſtee, and hath ſuch a charge committed to him for the good of that Church, unleſs he be called to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Deacon. Theſe things partly expreſs what the office of a Deacon is, and what it is for Deacons to put forth acts of their office. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>And then we deny their Major: If none may do ſuch works (without a call to thoſe offices) in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is peculiar to thoſe offices, to ſay, then much
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:120096:95"/>
leſs may any man preach the word, but he that is called to the office of the Miniſtry; this conſequence is feeble: for preaching is not an act peculiar to office, in it ſelf; but when performed by perſons under a ſpecial relation to thoſe that are preached to. Becauſe a man may not perform an act of office without a call to that Office, therefore he may not exerciſe a gift, in doing that which is no act peculiar to Office, this doth not follow.</p>
               <p>If none may adminiſter the Sacrament, but he that is lawfully called and ordained <note place="margin">Argune. 4 Jus Divin. Min. p. 87.</note> thereunto; then neither may any preach, but he that is lawfully called and ordained. But none may adminiſter the Sacraments, but he that is lawfully called and ordained thereunto. Therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny the conſequence of the Major: it doth not follow, that if none may adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but he that is lawfully called and ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then neither may any preach, but he that is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called and ordained.</p>
               <p>By being lawfully called and ordained, they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, a being called and ordained to office, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where they expreſs it; otherwiſe we may grant their whole argument, and yet gifted Brethren may preach: for the concluſion will be no more but this; therefore none may preach, but he that is lawfully called and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
               <p>We have proved that gifted men are called and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, or appointed by God in his word to preach; and therefore in this ſenſe it concludeth nothing againſt their preaching.</p>
               <p>Yet neither way is the conſequence good: though it be true, that none may preach without a lawful call, yet it doth not follow, that if gifted men may not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments, then they may not preach; for the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:120096:96"/>
adminiſtration of the Sacraments may be peculiar to Office, and preaching not be ſo.</p>
               <p>But let us hear their proof of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The connexion is clear, becauſe that theſe two works are joyntly in the ſame <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 8 8.</note> Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and of the two, the preaching of the word is the greater work: this the Apoſtle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptiſe, but to preach the Goſpel.</hi> The negative parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is here (as in many other places) taken for the comparative; he was ſent rather to preach, then to baptize: and by this manner of expreſſion it appears, that to preach was his more proper and eſpecial work.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This argument is as ſtrong againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as againſt us; for, they allow and frequently put men upon preaching as probationers, who are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, yet they will not allow them a power to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, or adminiſter the Lords Supper ſo much as once, until they have taken Orders (as they call it) or have received Ordination. By which it is evident, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do ſeparate between the power of preaching and of baptizing. If they give liberty to preach but one Sermon before Ordination, yet if they will not give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to baptize one perſon, or to adminiſter the Lords ſupper once, then they ſeparate thoſe works which are joyned together in the ſame commiſſion, as well as we; and when they anſwer the argument for themſelves, they do it for us alſo. By the ſame argument and their practiſe, we may prove that their Minor is falſe, and may juſtify men out of Office in their adminiſtring the Sacraments: for that we may argue thus:</p>
               <p>All that may preach, may baptize, for there is the ſame commiſſion for preaching and for baptizing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28, 19, 20. and preaching is the great, if not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:120096:96"/>
work of a Miniſter. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. But according to our brethrens principles and practiſes, ſome men un-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained may preach as probationers, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er work. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſome men un-ordained (according to our brethrens principles and practiſes) may baptize, which is the leſſer work.</p>
               <p>2. It is judged by ſome, that <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. is a commiſſion given to the Apoſtles as officers, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to thoſe that ſucced them in Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power; and that gifted men preach not by vertue of that, but another commiſſion, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if it be taken this way, then their Argument runneth thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If none may adminiſter the Sacrament but he that is lawfully called and ordained thereunto, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may any preach Office-wiſe, or by Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, but he that is lawfully called and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this we may grant, and yet may aſſert that ſome may preach by gift, and by vertue of another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, who may have no allowance to adminiſter the Sacraments. As the ſeventy Diſciples had power to preach, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Yet we do not read that they had power to baptize; and yet the twelve Apoſtles did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, as well as preach, <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.—<hi>Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples then John; though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples.</hi> So that it is no new thing, for ſome as Officers to preach and baptize, and for others (by another commiſſion) to preach on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not baptize.</p>
               <p>3. The Argument is built upon this miſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> That the commiſſion whereby men are authorized and empowred to preach, is holden forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Whereas this (as we conceive) is no Office-making commiſſion, but an enlargement of the commiſſion of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:120096:97"/>
Officers. It is not that which authorizeth either to preach or baptize, but it is that which empowereth preachers and baptizers to put forth ſuch acts towards ſuch perſons. It was not that which made them preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or baptizers, who were ſpoken to, but that which made the Nations the Gentiles capable of being preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and baptized. For, the Apoſtles were long before this made Officers, and were authorized both to preach and baptize: See <hi>Mark</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7. <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth,</hi>—verſ. 7.—<hi>Preach, ſaying, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. And Jeſus baptized by theſe Diſciples,</hi> John 4. verſ. 1, 2. And therefore they could not again be conſtituted Officers, or empowered to preach or baptize; they could not in propriety of ſpeech be ſaid to be made Officers by any new act, who were Officers of the ſame kind before that act; they could not be twice conſtituted, unleſs the former conſtitution were loſt before they received the later. The Apoſtles received as much power by this commiſſion, or command of Chriſt, as any of their Succeſſors can receive by it: for it is directed to them expreſly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Then the eleven Diſciples went away into Galilee.</hi>—verſ. 18. <hi>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given unto me in Heaven and earth.</hi> Verſe 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and diſciple all Nations, baptizing them</hi>—Yet, the Apoſtles could not receive power to preach or baptiſe, or become Officers by it; for they had ſuch power, and were Officers before; and therefore the intent of Chriſt herein, is this, That he having obtained all power to give ſalvation, not onely to the Jews, but alſo to the Gentiles; now he would have the Nations of the Gentiles preached to; and upon believing; be baptized. Whereas formerly he ſaid to them, <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles.</hi>—
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:120096:97"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. now he commandeth them to go into the way of the Gentiles. This miſſion doth not make men lawful preachers or baptizers, (as we ſhewed formerly) who had not ſuch a power before; but it warranteth lawful preachers and baptizers, in their preaching to, and baptizing of Gentiles. It did then, and doth now make Gentiles capable Objects of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and capable Subjects of baptiſm when they are made Diſciples. As for example: Suppoſe the Lord ſhould have ſaid to preachers or Officers in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Go not to the Indians; but go to the Engliſh and preach and baptize; and after ſome years ſhould have ſaid to the ſame preachers or Officers, Now go to the Indians, and preach and baptize them; this latter miſſion to the Indians could not rationally be deemed an Office-making act, nor that which gave them power to preach or baptize, becauſe they were Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and had ſuch a power before: neither could it be argued, that all who might preach to the Indians, might alſo baptize, becauſe both works are in the ſame commiſſion; but onely it might be concluded, that ſuch as had power to preach, might now lawfully preach to the Indians; and ſuch as had power to baptize, might now lawfully baptize Indians when converted: and ſo is the caſe alledged, as may be ſeen, by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>v</hi> 5, 6, 7. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. together.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man were an Officer to a Church in New-England, &amp; many hundreds of the Indians ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and added to this Church; the addition of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers maketh him an Officer to more then he was before, but doth not make him more an Officer then he was.</p>
               <p>That place is not intended to ſhew who have power to preach and baptize, but to ſhew who may be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and baptized by thoſe that have power: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deny, that the joyning thoſe two works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:120096:98"/>
in the ſame commiſſion, doth conclude, that all they which may do the one work, may alſo do the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>4. It is denyed by ſome, that preaching of the word is a greater work then baptizing.</p>
               <p>Saith Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> The ſealing of a Deed is a greater Act then the writing, reading, <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> Church-caſes clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>page</hi> 47.</note> or publiſhing of a Deed. Every Clerk may write out a Deed, but onely the conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer or owner may ſeal a Deed. Preaching is to all, even to Infidels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm belongs onely to thoſe that are reckoned to to be within the Covenant.—And he addeth—1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. doth not intimate, that preaching is greater then baptiſing—for the Apoſtle <note place="margin">

                  </gap>; intimating, that men in baptiſme were baptized into the Name of Chriſt (as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.) but not in one Sermon of many is a man in any degree brought unto Chriſt.—To juſtifie himſelf, that he had baptized but few; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats his commiſſion, (not the prelation of preaching above baptizing) <hi>viz.</hi> that he had his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>5. Suppoſe that preaching the word be a greater work then baptizing; yet it doth not follow, that thoſe who may preach, may alſo baptize: a work leſs weighty in it ſelf, may by a Divine inſtitution be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Officers; and a work more weighty, not be ſo limited.

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. To uſurp authority over the Church, is a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:120096:98"/>
ſin. But to preach without Calling and Ordination to the work, is to uſurp autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 88.</note> over the Church. Therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny, that to preach without Ordination to the work, is to uſurp authority over the Church. Gifted men do not preach without Calling, though they have not Ordination, which our Brethren aſſert to be eſſential to a Call.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſuppoſe our Brethren underſtand here by Ordination, (as they do elſewhere) a ſolemn ſetting apart by faſting and prayer, and impoſition of hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Argument neceſſarily ſuppoſeth that there is ſuch an Ordination to [the work] of preaching: and yet we can find no Arguments either here or elſewhere produced by them, to prove that ſuch Ordination to the work of preaching is neceſſary by Chriſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Yet their poſition which all theſe Arguments are produced to prove, is this, [That <hi>(pag.</hi> 80.) none may undertake the work of the Miniſtry, but he that is ſolemnly ſet apart thereunto: or, That <hi>(pag.</hi> 76.) none may do the work of the Miniſtry without Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] And therefore, if it be not proved, [That Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is by Goſpel-Rules to the work,] the poſition is not confirmed at all: yet for ought we ſee, this they leave all alongſt unproved. Their third Argument ſpeaketh of an Officer, a Deacon being ſo ordained: but the utmoſt that this can conclude, is, That none may undertake an Office, or do a work Office-wiſe without Ordination; but this is far from p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, that none may do that work at all, without ſuch Ordination. None may diſtribute as an Officer, as a Deacon, but he that is ordained to the work. <hi>Ergo,</hi> None may diſtribute at all, but he that is ordained to the work,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:120096:99"/>
None may exhort or rebuke as an Officer, without he be ordained to the works: <hi>Ergo,</hi> None may exhort or rebuke at all, without he be ordained to the works. What ſhadow of a conſequence is here? Yet no better do we find in the caſe in hand: their poſition is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, That none may do the work of the Miniſtry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination. Their proofs are particular, becauſe none may do the work as Officers without Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore neceſſary, for the confirming their main Poſition, and this Argument, that they prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Ordination, or a ſolemn ſetting apart by faſting, prayer, and impoſition of hands, is neceſſary not onely to the Office, but to the work of preaching: Or that none may do that work without ſuch Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As yet we can ſee no proof for this; if we could, we would exhort gifted men to take up ſuch Ordination to the work of preaching: but if this could be proved, we ſhould queſtion whether they were Officers or no by this Ordination; for though they were ordained to that work, yet it is poſſible they might not be ordained to the Office, of which that is but one part, when a man is in Office. Therefore it is further to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That none may do the work of preaching, but one in Office: or that none may be ordained to that work, without being ordained to Office: Or, that preaching the word is a work peculiar to men in Office. Elſe ſome gifted men out of Office may perform it; for what is not peculiar to Office, may be performed by ſome who are no Officers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That to preach without Ordination to the work, is to uſurp authority over the Church. If it were granted, that none might preach the Word but ſuch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:120096:99"/>
as are ordained to that work; yet ſuch as preached without Ordination, might not uſurp authority over the Church:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe preaching in it ſelf is not (that we can find) an act of authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch unordained men might preach to Heathens, or Indians, where no Church is planted; and how the preaching could be uſurping authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church, when no Church were preached to, we ſee not. It might be a ſin againſt Chriſt, but yet no uſurping authority over the Church.</p>
               <p>But they endeavour to prove their Minor, by aſſerting preaching to be an act of Authority: if that were granted, yet but one part of their Minor is proved; they ſhould alſo have proved, that none have that authority, without Ordination: otherwiſe we might ſay, Preaching is an act of authority, but yet men may preach without Ordination to the work; for there are other ways to inveſt men with authority to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch an act, beſides and without Ordination; yet they have given us no proof that Ordination is that onely which authorizeth to perform ſuch a work.</p>
               <p>To prove that preaching is an act of authority, they ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1.—The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. gives this charge, <hi>Know them that are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you;</hi> where to admoniſh, is to be over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Text doth plainly difference and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>[being over,]</hi> from the <hi>[admoniſhing them;]</hi> and yet our Brethren produce this place, to prove that they are the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>[being over them]</hi> denoteth their place, the <hi>[admoniſhing of them]</hi> denoteth but one work
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:120096:100"/>
performed by thoſe that are in ſuch a place. Officers are there ſpoken of, and they admoniſh thoſe they ſtand in that relation to, as being over them: and if it be an act of authority when performed under ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; yet it doth not follow, that it is ſo, by whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be performed.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle aſſerteth Chriſt to be an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedec, Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and giveth a reaſon of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. and in the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and greatneſs of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> he ſetteth forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſt, <hi>who is after has order. ver.</hi> 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he proveth the greatneſs of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and ſo of Chriſt, becauſe he bleſſed <hi>Abraham, ver.</hi> 6. and ſo muſt be greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> who received the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. without all contradiction, the leſs is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the greater. But what is all this to prove that preaching is an act of authority? Doe preachers ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> or Chriſt? Can they bleſs with a High-prieſts bleſſing? Are they greater then <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as he that gave this bleſſing was? There is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of reverence and worſhip, ſo men bleſs God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 19. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who dayly</hi>

                  <hi>londeth us with his benefits.</hi>—There is a bleſſing of Charity, ſo men bleſs one another by mutual prayer.—<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Bleſs them which perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, bleſs and curſe not.</hi> It is required as a duty, not of preachers only, but of all Chriſtians thus to bleſs; yet neither of theſe kindes of bleſſing do imply ſuperiority, or authority, or that he is greater who bleſſeth, then he that is bleſſed. He that bleſſeth by an Original inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent power as Chriſt doth, he is greater then he that is bleſſed; and of ſuch bleſſing the Text ſpeaketh: but he that bleſſeth Miniſterially and inſtrumentally, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:120096:100"/>
greater then he that is bleſſed, nor is the bleſſing alwayes an act of authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The Apoſtle ſuffers not women to preach, becauſe they may not uſurp authority over the man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. but is commanded to be in ſubjection; upon which place, <hi>Oecum.—The very act of teaching is to uſurp authority over the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a plain diſtinction and difference made in the very text alledged, between [teaching] and [uſurping authority,] for the words are theſe: <hi>[But I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurp authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the man, but to be in ſilence.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 12.] That particle <hi>[nor]</hi> doth plainly intimate, that two things are forbidden. 1. Teaching. 2. Uſurping authority.</p>
               <p>And a womans uſurping authority over her husband. ſeemeth to be the thing directly forbidden by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, rather then the uſurping of authority over the Church; and hence the words are, <hi>nor uſurp authority over [the man:]</hi> and the reaſons inforcing it, from <hi>the mans being firſt created.</hi> ver. 13. and from <hi>the womans being firſt deceived.</hi> ver. 14. ſpeak it to be an uſurping authority over her husband, rather then over the Church, that is forbidden.</p>
               <p>However, there is no ſuch thing found in the Text, as that the act of teaching is to uſurp authority over the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. The publick work of the Miniſtry of the word, is an authoritative adminiſtration, like unto that of Cryers, Heralds and Embaſſadors, to be performed in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and therefore may not be performed by any but ſuch as are authorized, and immediately or mediately deputed by him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. appears, becauſe in preaching, the Key of the Kingdom of Heaven is uſed.—</p>

               <p>2. A warrant from the written word to preach, is authority enough: and this we have ſhewn gifted men have.</p>
               <p>If men who are not authorized by Chriſt to preach, will do it; and if this be an uſurping of authority; yet what is all this to prove, either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is to uſurp authority over the Church? Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to preach without Ordination to the work, is to uſurp ſuch authority over the Church? Theſe are the things which not being proved, their Argument falleth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is a Key of Knowledge, we grant, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 52. which Chriſtians who are not in Office, may uſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. And in Diſcipline, the power of</p>
               <p n="1">1. Excommunication is the binding Key, that which ſhutteth the Kingdom of Heaven, the Church, againſt offendors.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>Here, the binding Key, and the looſing Key, are uſed about Church-cenſures; and if both theſe were given to the Officers onely (which we deny) yet, gifted men might preach; neither can they gain any thing from the Keyes to prove that preaching is an Act of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, much leſs to prove their Propoſition.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. That which the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, may no man practiſe. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reproves uncalled men for preaching. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The Minor (ſay they) appears, in that the falſe prophets are reproved, <hi>Jerem.</hi>

The falſe prophets themſelves accuſe <hi>Jeremiah, Jerem.</hi> 29. 27. for making himſelf a prophet; which though it was a moſt unjuſt and falſe impuration, yet it holds forth this truth: That no man ought to make himſelf a prophet, the falſe prophets themſelves being witneſſes.—The Apoſtles in the Synod of Jeruſalem, ſpeak of certain men that went out from them.—They went out: they were not ſent out, but they went out, of their own accord; and this is ſpoken of them by way of reproof. And then it follows, <hi>They troubled you with words, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting your ſoules.</hi> He that preacheth unſent, is—not a builder, but a ſubverter of ſouls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny that the Scripture reproves the preaching of gifted men, who are unordianed to Office.</p>
               <p>This Argument, if it were wholly granted, yet it proves not at all what it is produced for. Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, That none may do the work of the Miniſtry without Ordination, or being ſolemnly ſet apart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Their Argument to prove this, is, The Scripture reproveth uncalled men for preaching, therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:120096:102"/>
men may not preach. We may grant that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called men may not preach; and yet may aſſert that unordained men (if gifted) may preach. For, gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men are called to preach, though they be not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
               <p>Let them prove that Ordination is the onely Call to preach; if it were granted that Ordination is the Call to Office, (as elſewhere they endeavour to prove) yet it would not follow, that there is no Call to preach without that; unleſs it can be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there is no preaching, but by Office.</p>
               <p>2. The places alledged fall ſhort of proving their Argument: as for <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. 21, 32. We ſpake to that, when we inſiſted upon their Argument about miſſion. It is plain, that if they had not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied lies, they had not been reproved. For, if they had declared Gods Counſel, Gods Word to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then he would have followed their labours with his bleſſing; and therefore they <hi>(verſe</hi> 22.) are not reproved for propheſying without a Call to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, but being called to be prophets, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for not preaching the Word of God to that people.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Jerem.</hi> 29. 27. It is a weak and ſlender proof, that no man ought to make himſelf a prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the falſe prophets ſaid ſo; <hi>For falſe witneſſes will tell lies, Prov.</hi> 14. 5. how ſhall this be credited upon their teſtimonie, more then other things? they are ſaid to propheſie lies; and this might be ſuſpected to be one, if onely they did witneſs it to be a truth.</p>
               <p>But we ſay, that ſome unordained men are made prophets by the Lord, in his affording them the gift of propheſie, and warranting them by his Word to exerciſe that gift; and ſo they do not make themſelves prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:120096:102"/>
As for <hi>Act.</hi> 15. We cannot ſee any ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they are reproved becauſe they went forth from them, but becauſe they troubled the brethren, &amp; ſubverted their ſouls,—<hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>For aſmuch as we have heard, that certain which next out from us, have troubled you with words, ſubverting your ſouls.—]</hi> Suppoſe ſome members of a claſſical Presbytery, who have taken up Ordination in that way, ſhould go to a Church at a diſtance, and broach falſe doctrine; might not the Claſſis write in the ſame manner to ſuch a Church, [—<hi>We have heard that certain which went out from us, have troubled you?—]</hi> Surely this would be proper enough, becauſe really they went from them, and poſſibly without their knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; yet this could not be underſtood to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof for their preaching without Ordination; for, they were ordained long before they went out; and therefore if it ſhould caſt blame upon them for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without miſſion, it muſt be meant of a miſſion which is not Ordination, for that they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and of ſuch a miſſion as preſuppoſeth a Call to preach, for (according to our Brethrens principles) they had a Call to preach before, by being ordianed; and therefore this doth not evidence that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reproveth uncalled or unordained men for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. We argue from the practiſe of the Miniſters of Chriſt: if they have been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt. pag.</hi> 90.</note> to make proof of their miſſion, as of their doctrine, then is miſſion required in him that will preach the word. But they have been thus careful. Therefore. If any gifted man may preach without a Call, why doth the Apoſtle ſo often make mention of his Call? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Argument laboureth with the ſame diſeaſe that the former did: if it be wholly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the preaching of gifted men unordained, is not diſproved. Still they confound a Call to preach, Miſſion and Ordination, which are different things.</p>
               <p>We grant, that none may preach without a Call; but we deny that Ordination is that Call, without which none may preach. We know not of any that plead for preaching without a Call; the queſtion here is, what that Call is?</p>
               <p>2. The reaſon why the Apoſtle ſo often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of his Call, as we conceive, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To vindicate himſelf from the reproaches of the falſe Teachers, who called in queſtion his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and all this gifted men unordained do, when they defend their Call to preach, againſt thoſe that queſtion it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or to vindicate the doctrine which he preached, and to adde a confirmation thereof: the falſe Teachers called his doctrine into queſtion; and to prove the truth of that, he aſſerteth himſelf not onely to have a Call, (for he might have had a mediate Call, and yet his doctrine might have been falſe, and ſo that could not have evinced it to be true) but an immediate Call; and this doth help to prove the Divineneſs of his doctrine.</p>
               <p>Hence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>But I certifie you Brethren,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:120096:103"/>
that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man; for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> verſ. 20.—<hi>I lie not.</hi> He evidenceth his Doctrine not to be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but divine, from his receiving it not by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſtry of man, but by extraordinary and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> and others made proof of their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate call, therefore miſſion or a call, is required in him that will preach the word; or therefore none may preach without a call, it's no good conſequence. Though we deny not the concluſion itſelf, yet we do not ſee how it can neceſſarily be inferred from ſuch a premiſe. For it was neceſſary that <hi>Paul</hi> and others ſhould make proof of their immediate call, that thereby they might evidence the divineneſs of the Doctrines of the Goſpel, which they preached; but there is no ſuch reaſon which makes it neceſſary to make proof of a mediate call; and if it be done, yet that end cannot be attained there. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Ordination were the onely mediate call, a man could not prove his Doctrine to be divine, becauſe he hath that call; for men rightly ordained may preach falſe Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Whereas they alleadge <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, Chriſt did not in his own perſon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, as is plain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2.—<hi>Jeſus himſelf bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed not, but his diſciples.</hi> And therefore our Brethren do ungroundedly aſſert, that Chriſts undertaking to baptize is juſtified by his miſſion; for Chriſt himſelf did not then undertake to be an Adminiſtrator of Baptiſm; and therefore could not be juſtified by miſſion or any thing elſe in baptizing.</p>
               <p>There is not a ſyllabe in the Text about the diſciples
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:120096:104"/>
miſſion, yet they were the Adminiſtrators of the Baptiſm there ſpoken of; and ſo it muſt be their miſſion (if any) not Chriſts, that muſt juſtifie the adminiſtration. If Chriſts miſſion would juſtifie the diſciples baptizing, why may it not as well juſtifie gifted mens preaching? but how would this at all prove that Miniſters made proof of their miſſion, or that miſſion is required in him that will preach the word? Becauſe the diſciples bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing was juſtified by Chriſts miſſion, therefore other mens preaching or baptizing muſt be juſtified by their own miſſion; or they were juſtified by anothers, by Chriſts miſſion, therefore miſſion is required in him that will preach the word, himſelf muſt have miſſion; what ſhaddow of a conſequence is here? Yet if Chriſts miſſion doth juſtifie any, it muſt be his diſciples bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing; for Chriſt himſelf baptized not.</p>
               <p>Chriſt commanded the diſciples to baptize, (though that be not here mentioned) and they baptized into Chriſts Name; and thence it may be ſaid that Chriſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, though in his own perſon he baptized not; and ſuppoſe Chriſts miſſion did here juſtifie this, yet how would this prove that miſſion is required in him that will be an Adminiſtrator of ſuch an Ordinance, becauſe it was required in Chriſt, who was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor of, and Appointer to, ſuch Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, we cannot finde Chriſts miſſion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at all in that place, much leſs is it alledged to juſtifie his baptizing, or undertaking to baptize, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 27, 28 <hi>John anſwered and ſaid, A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven; ye your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent before him.</hi> Here <hi>Iohns</hi> miſſion is mentioned, but not a word of Chriſts. Saith <hi>Iohn, [I am ſent before
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:120096:104"/>
him,]</hi> i. e. before Chriſt. But if <hi>Iohns</hi> miſſion juſtified Chriſts Diſciples in undertaking to baptize, ſtill this would prove, that one mans miſſion may juſtifie other men in baptizing; and ſo it is far from proving, that miſſion is required to the perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that will baptize; it rather proves that anothers miſſion may ſerve the turn, without one of his own.</p>
               <p>If they would fetch it from thoſe words, <hi>[A man can receive nothing unleſs it be given him.—]</hi> Theſe words may refer to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as well as to Chriſt; <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples murmur, becauſe Chriſts Diſciples baptized ſo many, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>John</hi> anſwereth, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>A man can, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid, I have nothing but by Gods gift, and therefore have cauſe to be thankful for what I have, rather then to be ambitious of more honor, or envious againſt Chriſt, becauſe more is given to him then to me: <hi>It is not given to me</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) to be the Meſſias,</hi> as verſ. 28. <hi>Ye your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, [I am not to Chriſt:]</hi> It is not given to me to increaſe, as it is to Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. Or if it doth refer to Chriſt, then it may found thus: It is given to Chriſt to be a Soveraign, elſe he could not by his Diſciples baptize ſo many into his Name.</p>
               <p>But take it either of theſe ways, yet it ſpeaketh nothing about miſſion, or its being required in him that will adminiſter ſuch Ordinances; for, in the former ſenſe there is no ſhadow of it: admit it be taken in the latter ſenſe, yet he doth not ſpeak here (whatever may be ſaid in other places) of any Office, which was given to the Diſciples, who were the baptizers; but of what was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt, into whoſe Name they baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:120096:105"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. When the chief Prieſts and Scribes, with the Elders, asked Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 2. <hi>Tell us by what authority doſt thou theſe things? or who gave thee this authority?</hi> Chriſt makes anſwer by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another queſtion: <hi>The baptiſm of John, was it from Heaven, or of men?</hi> which teacheth us—that none ought to preach, without being authorized and ſent.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How ſo general a concluſion can be enforced thence, we ſee not; neither have they made it out. If one ſhould ask a Colonel or a Captain of an Army, by what authority he fighteth, and he ſhould alledge anothers teſtimony who is credible, to evidence that he hath authority; will it hence follow, that no common Souldier may fight without being authorized and ſent? Surely no.</p>
               <p>2. If they ſpeak of a being authorized, and ſent by men, there is not any thing in the Text to favour it; for, Chriſt was not ſent or authorized by man. <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm did not authorize Chriſt to preach. Becauſe Chriſt alledgeth <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, to ſhew that he had authority from God to preach; therefore none ought to preach without being authorized and ſent by men, this followeth not.</p>
               <p>3. If by authority and miſſion to preach, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend onely this, A lawful right or warrant to preach; then we have proved that gifted men have that, though they be not ordained. Chriſt hath warranted them by his Word thereunto, without mens ſending. Gifted men may alledge the Word of Chriſt to defend their preaching, as Chriſt did <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm to juſtifie his preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. We argue thus: That work may not be performed by any, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 91.</note> by him be performed in faith: but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:120096:105"/>
preaching by a brother gifted, but not called or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, cannot be done in faith. Therefore a gifted unordained brother may not preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny their Minor; and we affirme that preaching by a Brother gifted, but not ordained, may be done in faith. As for the word <hi>called,</hi> it is not in their poſition; and if we ſhould gtant, that ſuch as are not called cannot preach in faith, yet we may ſay, gifted men not ordained, may do it in faith, for they are called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The truth of the Minor (they ſay) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that there is no warrant in Scripture (which is the ground of faith) for ſuch a practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We refer the Reader to our Arguments before urged, for the preaching of gifted men, which do—evidence that they have warrant in Scripture (which is the ground of faith) for ſuch a practiſe; and may ſerve as a full anſwer to this Argument: we prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, that gifted men have Scripture-precepts, promiſe, and example—to warrant their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore they may in faith do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2.—If there were a precept, it was then a neceſſary duty that every gifted perſon ought to perform; it was a ſin if any gifted perſon ſhould not preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it is a duty, and a ſin to neglect it; but in ſome caſes, a not preaching is no ſinful neglect. This Objection we had before; and the Reader may find the full anſwer to it, in our reply to their ſecond Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. There is no precept that any ſhould hear them, or obey them in the Lord, or maintaine them: theſe duties of the people are appropriated to thoſe that are preachers by Office, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7.—<hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. The hearing of them, is the hearing of Chriſt.—
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:120096:106"/>
It is not ſo ſaid of any that preach without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but contrarily there is a ſtrict charge not to hearken to ſuch, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 14. and a complaint of them that heap to themſelves teachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17.—So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of double honour,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing of this is ſpoken of gifted Brethren; yet if they may lawfully preach, all this may they challenge, and all that hear and plead for them, are bound in conſcience to yield, becauſe all this is due for the works ſake, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Lord hath warranted gifted men to preach (as we have proved) and that doth neceſſarily imply a precept to hear, and obey the word of the Lord, which is declared by them.</p>
               <p>2. Some of the places may ſpeak of a more eſpecial obligation between Officers, and thoſe they are Officers to, then between others; but do not deny that others may be heard, or that the word is to be obeyed when ſuch as are no Officers ſpeak it: becauſe the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, will any ſay, that others lips who are no Officers, are not to preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or that people are not to enquire or ſeek the Law at the lips of any other? are not the Saints to exhort one another? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. and is no this a means to encreaſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? and are they not to be heard when they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:120096:106"/>
do exhort? and ſeeing Chriſt commandeth them to give exhortation, do not they hear Chriſt that hear them, when they declare the will of Chriſt, at his command? Thoſe places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. do affirm that ſuch as are Officers, and do labour conſtantly amongſt a people, and make it their work to feed them, are eſpecially to be obeyed, and highly eſteemed by thoſe they are over in the Lord, and that for their works ſake; but this doth not deny that others may ſhare, in ſome good degree, in that honour and eſteem; nor that they are to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who do the work but occaſionally amongſt them, and are not Officers to them or over them in the Lord: as if a Stranger who liveth a hundred miles off, and is over a flock there, cometh and preacheth ſeveral Sermons to a Church at ſuch a diſtance, upon requeſt, he is not an Officer to this Church, or over it, becauſe he cannot (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſerting a height of Epiſcopacy) be ſaid to be an Officer to two Churches a hundred miles diſtant; and he may be an Officer to ten or twenty Churches, by the ſame Rule (for ought we know) that he may be to two; yet preaching thus occaſionally to a Church which he is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he is to be obeyed (if he preacheth ſound Doctrine) and to be eſteemed for his works ſake, as we ſuppoſe will not be denyed: and why may there not as well be liberty for the preaching of gifted men, without croſſing thoſe Scriptures?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:120096:107"/>
There is a ſtrict charge not to hearken to thoſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 14. (we ſuppoſe that place they intend, though it be printed <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 14.) becauſe they preached falſe Doctrine, for it is ſaid, verſ. 14. <hi>Therefore hearken not unto the words of the Prophets that ſpeak unto you ſaying, ye ſhall not ſerve the King of Babylon. [for] they propheſie [a lie] unto you.</hi> Such as propheſie a lie unto men, are not to be hearkened unto, though they be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; this is as much againſt hearing Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men as gifted men.</p>
               <p>As for 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. the words are theſe, verſ. 3. <hi>For the time will come, when they will not indure ſound Doctrine, but after their own lusts ſhall they heap to themſelves teachers.</hi>—</p>
               <p>It is a matter indeed of complaint, when men heap up to themſelves ſuch Teachers as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own luſts and corruptions; and when averſneſs to ſound Doctrine puts them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this; for it is not like they will be preachers of ſound Doctrine, who in ſuch a caſe are heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up: but this ſpeaketh nothing againſt the heaping up Teachers out of a deſire to hear ſound Doctrine, and to have grace promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.—</p>

               <p>Goſpel precepts require, and Goſpel preſidents hold forth, that thoſe that are to Preach the Goſpel, ſhould not onely have inward gifts, and graces, and an outward call and Election; but alſo that they ſhould be ſolemnly ſet apart for that work. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inward Graces and gifts, and the election and call of the people, are not all the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If his propoſition be not underſtood to be univerſal; it may be granted, and yet nothing is concluded by it againſt the Preaching of gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we may grant that ſuch a ſetting apart, by Goſpel precepts is required, and by Goſpel Preſidents is holden forth, as neceſſary for [ſome] of thoſe that are to Preach the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> for Officers, and yet may fairly deny it to be neceſſary for all that Preach. Other Goſpel Precepts and Preſidents may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low gifted men to Preach without ſuch a ſetting apart.</p>
               <p>Becauſe ſome who are to admoniſh and exhort others, and convince gainſayers, ought to be ſet apart. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all muſt or none may admoniſh, or exhort others, or convince gainſayers but ſuch as are ſet apart. Surely himſelf will not judge this a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. We ſuppoſe therefore he would have the propoſition underſtood Univerſally, and then none of the Scriptures he alledgeth, do prove it. We deny, That Goſpel Precepts require, or that Goſpel Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

the Paſtor may teach, and the Teacher may exhort and baptize; but to difference this gift of his from the gift of exhorting. If ſheweth that every one is to give moſt attendance to that work which his gift lieth moſt towards whether it be teaching or exhorting. This doth as much deny that Paſtors may Teach as that gifted brethren may: or this denieth it to be an act of the Paſtors office to Teach, as much as it aſſerteth it to be an act peculiar to the Teacher.</p>
               <p>If by [proper acts] he doth not mean [acts peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar] to Elders, Biſhops, Paſtors, Teachers: then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his major. There are ſome proper acts of Elders, Biſhops, Paſtors and Teachers, which are not acts of office.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of the whole buſineſſe, let theſe things be conſidered.</p>

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:120096:111"/>
2. That ſome are proper acts (materially) of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which are not proper acts formally of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Diſtribution is materially an act of a Deacons Office, and yet it is not formally an act of his Office, for others may diſtribute who are no Deacons, If we ſhould argue thus about others acts, the fallacy would be eaſily ſeen. The proper acts of Deacons are acts of Office; but receiving and diſtributing of worldly goods are proper acts of Deacons. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and diſtributing of worldly goods are acts of Office.</p>
               <p>This arguing is like that which <hi>Mr. Collings</hi> uſeth: but it may eaſily be anſwered that Receiving and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing are but materially proper acts of Deacons, and therefore others who are no Deacons may perform thoſe acts; they are not formally acts of a Deacon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe performed in ſuch a manner, under ſuch a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Preaching, interpreting and applying ſcriptures are the proper matter of thoſe acts which Elders, Biſhops, Paſtors and Teachers put forth, but they are not formally acts of Elders <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> they are no acts of Elders as Elders, or of Biſhops as Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſſe performed in ſuch a manner, as under ſuch a Relation to thoſe they are performed to. None of the Scriptures alleadged prove, that they are ſuch proper acts as belong to them and none elſe.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>If Baptizing be an act of Office; which an Officer onely can do, then Preaching is. The reaſon is plain, for Chriſt in the ſame Commiſſion authorizeth thoſe to baptize whom he authorizeth to preach, Matth.</hi> 28 19, 20 <hi>But baptizing is an act of Office, &amp;c. Ergo, Mr. Collings</hi> wondereth that any are thy at baptizing, and yet dare venture to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This argument is anſwered before, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forth Argument uſed by the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters in their <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſter. pag.</hi> 87. we refer the

Reader to our anſwers to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Brethren will admit un-officed men to Preach as Probationers, and yet will not admit them to baptize: and ſo the Argument is as well againſt themſelves as againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That place <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. is not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which authorizeth men to preach or baptize, but authorizeth the Nations or <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be preached to and baptized, by thoſe that have power to perform ſuch acts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a limitation in the very Text alleadged, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. They are to preach to the Nations, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but they could not be Officers to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were no members either of a univerſal, or any particular Church, before they were preached to, and therefore the preaching to them could be then no act of Office, becauſe Church and Officers are Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and here they preached to ſuch as were no Church. But the Text requireth that they ſhould be made diſciples before they were baptized, verſe 19. <hi>Diſciple ye all Nations baptizing them.</hi> Now a diſciple is one in the ſchool of Chriſt his Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is more probable that Church Officers were onely to baptize, then that they onely might preach, becauſe Church-memberſhip is pre-required unto bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, not ſo to being preached to.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wee finde that men out of Office are allowed to perform the ſame acts which have the denomination of preaching, and that for the ſame end: Men out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may admoniſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. and exhort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 25.

               <p>Where doth the Goſpel allow men out of Office to perform that act which is called baptiſing, and that for the proper end which that Ordinance of baptiſm is

               <p>To prove this Propoſition, he endevoureth to prove, 1. That ordinary preaching is the chief act of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Function. 2. That it is uſeleſſe as to this act, if every gifted perſon may do it.</p>
               <p>To evince the firſt, That ordinary preachiug, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and applying ſcripture is the chief act of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Function, he layeth down two or three things.</p>

               <p>2. If it were an office-making Commiſſion, yet that doth not prove that preaching is the chief act of the Miniſterial function, becauſe it is the firſt act. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of words is an unſafe ground to build an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, and here more then in other ſcriptures, becauſe preaching was to be in order of time firſt, or before baptizing of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be fitted for baptiſm, and therefore preaching might be firſt mentioned, though baptizing were the chief act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Homes,</hi> In his <hi>Church Caſes cleared, pag.</hi> 49. ſaith, <q>Preaching is but a preparation to baptiſm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

cannot be a greater thing then baptiſm. And if order of words were a forcible argument, we might prove baptizing to be the chief act, for that is put before preaching, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. verſe 4.</q> 
                  <hi>John did [bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize] in the wilderneſſe, and preach.</hi> Here is firſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing mentioned, and then preaching.</p>

               <p>2.

And ſo, adminiſtring of Sacraments, though a leſſer work, yet may be the diſtinctive act of Paſtors and Teachers Office, and yet Preaching be their main work: for there is no neceſſitie that the diſtinctive act ſhould be the main work.</p>
               <p>4. Whatever others judge, (according to our preſent light) Preaching is the chief, and main work of an Officer. We do ingenouſly confeſs, that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. doth intimate to us, that it is a greater work, (eſpecially being performed office-wiſe) then bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing; Yet, we do not find any Scripture Rule to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Preaching in it ſelf, is either an act of Office, or peculiar to the diſtinctive act of Office; to make it ſo there is required a being over them in the Lord who are Preached to, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. And the Preaching as under ſuch a ſpecial Relation to them that are Preached to, as having them committed to his charge for that end, as his flock; this we conceive, doth make Preaching an Act of office; and it is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to office thus to Preach; and thus ſome Preaching is a diſtinctive act of Office.</p>
               <p>This we deſire may be well obſerved, for many are exceedingly troubled and perplexed under ſuch thoughts as theſe; if gifted men may Preach, and the Church may put forth acts of government towards particular members, then there remain no Acts peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to Officers but onely adminiſtring the Sacraments,

and theſe are leſſer acts then Preaching and governing, and ſo, Officers are of very little uſe in the Church, and next unto <hi>Cyphers,</hi> becauſe they can do very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more then other members may do, &amp;c. Such work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (we believe) are in the breaſts of many Saints. Whereas, if there were no acts performed by Officers, which in themſelves were incommunicable or peculiar to them; if all acts which Officers put forth, might be performed by members who are no Officers; yet there would remain a very vaſt difference between of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and other members, enough to ſpeak Officers to be very neceſſary, and of great uſe in the Church. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although Officers and other members put forth the ſame acts, towards the ſame perſons, yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Relation to the perſons which ſuch acts are put forth towards: they act under different Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this ſpeaketh a vaſt difference between their actings. As for example; A man provideth for his children under the relation of a father, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſtandeth under (by that relation) bindeth to provide for them; but he provideth for the poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another notion: here, the acts are the ſame for the matter of them, yet vaſtly different in the manner. The relation is not the ſame between the workers and the porlons who are the objects of the works. So, a Chriſtian friend or neighbonr may and ought to give gracious and wholſome inſtructions upon occaſion, to the children of his acquaintance, and the parent of the ſame children ought to give them ſuch inſtructions alſo; but, there is a vaſt difference between theſe acts, the one is under a ſtanding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation by the parental relation to perform ſuch acts, the other not. So, in ſome corporations, the power of determination of matters which concern the whole, reſideth in the Bayliffes and Free-men
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:120096:114"/>
of the Corporation, the Bayliffes act under a different relation to the Corporation, from that which the Free-men act under, yet they ſhare in the power as well as the Bayliffes, and the major part may carry matters without and againſt the Bayliffes, when the Bayliffes would run croſſe to their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>So, in Church affairs, the Officers Preach to the flock committed to their charge to be fed by them with the word and Doctrine, as under the ſpecial relation of Paſtors to the flock; and gifted men Preach alſo, to the ſame flock, but not as under ſuch a Relation to it. So, Church-officers put forth acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the flock is committed to them for overſight, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>the flock over the which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, &amp;c.</hi> They are over it in the Lord. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. and are to be obeyed as over it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves &amp;c.</hi> and therefore a miniſterial power of Government is granted to them by Jeſus Chriſt, and in reſpect of this their place they are ſet in, not under but over the flock, the Church is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its officers a Governed body, and they are ſtiled Governours, becauſe a ſpecial charge of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and Government is committed to them as a work and buſineſs which they are to give a ſpecial attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to. Yet all the members of the Church are to have an overſight each of other, and of the Officers themſelves, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Say to Archippus, take heed to the Miniſtry, which thou haſt received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it:</hi> the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> are exhorted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh their Officer <hi>Archippus,</hi> and ſo were to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee his converſation, elſe how could they know what to admoniſh him for? and if any brother offend, the offended (though no Officer) is to admoniſh; and if he doth not hear him, or one or two; not the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:120096:115"/>
onely, but the Church, is to admoniſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. 16, 17. tell it unto the Church, but if he neglect to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ear the Church, &amp;c. therefore the Church is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, elſe how can he hear it? and this admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a part of Government, for, if the Church be not heard, Communion with him is to be avoided, <hi>[let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the ſole power of Government is not in the officers, the Church hath a power to put forth ſome acts of it. The officers, are in a ſpecial ſenſe Governors, as being and or a more eſpecial deſignation to take cognizance of, and go before the Church in the ordering its affairs, then any other particular members. No other members can rightly challenge it as their place to be over the Church, as they may. But yet, a power of Government, is granted to the Church over its particular members, though its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings therein be not under the Relation of office. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Relation of a whole it putteth forth acts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its parts, as a boly it acteth ſometimes to the cutting off particular members for the preſervation of the body.</p>
               <p>If a Church hath Officers, they by their place are to go before the Church in directing and executing determinations according to the will of Chriſt, but the power (under Chriſt) of determination, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and excommunication reſideth in the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. the acts are, not of the Officers only, but of the, Church. If a Church cenſureth an offender when it hath officers; the officer acts towards that offender as one ſet over him in the Lord, &amp; who hath taken a ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial charge and overſight of his ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and urgeth duty upon him, becauſe elſe he ſhall ſinfully break the Law of that Relation which is between them, in croſſing ſtill the will of Chriſt; but the Church urgeth duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:120096:115"/>
the ſame offender, becauſe he ſhall elſe not onely ſin againſt Chriſt, but break the Law of his Relation to the body, which as a member he ought to keep.</p>
               <p>If a Church hath no officers, it cenſureth offenders as a free people, or ſpiritual corporation inveſted by Chriſt with ſuch a power, under the general Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as a body it is to ſeek the preſervation of it ſelf, and if poſſible the healing of its diſeaſed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For it is a Church ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, though it wanteth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and ſo the Rule of Chriſt runneth to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. No Church of Chriſt can be exemped from that Rule; Communion is to be avoided with ſuch perſons as will not hear any Church of Chriſt when it doth admoniſh for ſuch a cauſe as deſerveth admonition.</p>
               <p>Office-power where it is afforded, is but the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addition of another Relation to adde more chains to the offender, if he proveth obſtinate, and to prevail the more with him towards ſubmiſſion; but the power of the cenſure is in the Church, not in the officers onely. The officers are uſeful for the better manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cenſures, but have not the ſole power of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring. They are to Govern in cenſuring, but the Church hath a power to cenſure. Yet the Church doth not act under ſuch a Relation in cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uring, as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice doth; as in acts of Government in a Corporation the Bayliffes by their place and office are over the whole Corporation, yet the Free-men may have power for Admiſſion or ejection of members, into or out of the freedom of the place, and many by vote carry it without or againſt the Bayliffes, but when they concur, they act under one Relation, and the Freemen under another; and this different Relation makes a vaſt difference between the Bayliffes and the Freemen in their actings, though the matter of the acts be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No diſtinctive Acts are neceſſary (by our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:120096:116"/>
principles) for ſome officers: They aſſert-Ruling elders to be of Divine inſtitution, and yet theſe have no diſtinctive acts which they onely may perform, the main argument that Ruling is that which is accounted their moſt proper work, and yet that is not accounted incommunicable; for, they grant a Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to the Preaching elders as well as to them. If a ruling power may be communicable, without making the Ruling elders function fruſtraneous as to its main Act, why ſhould the Preaching of gifted men, render the Preaching elders office fruſtraneous, though Preaching be his chief Act. And indeed this is it which we deny in Maſter <hi>Collings</hi> Argument. <hi>viz.</hi> That the miniſtrial function or office, is uſeleſſe as to this Act of Preaching of every gifted perſon may do it. And now we expected ſome Scripture proof of this, the Argument being of no force if this be not proved, and all that we can find he ſaith to it, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> What need any particuliar perſons be by the Ordinance of God appointed, to do that which all may do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We do not ſay, that all may do it, but onely that thoſe who are really gifted may do it: all Chriſtians are not gifted.</p>
               <p>2. If there be Scripture warrant for the Preaching of gifted men, then it is needful, whether our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can ſee it ſo to be or not; for, none of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are needleſs.</p>
               <p>3. The granting liberty unto gifted men to Preach, doth not render it needleſſe for particular perſons to be by the Ordinance of God appointed to do it: in the Primitive times the Preaching of Apoſtles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and Prophets did not render it needleſſe for Paſtors and Teachers to be by an Ordinance of God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it, nor did the appointing of Paſtors and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:120096:116"/>
Teachers render Apoſtles, &amp;c. un-neceſſary. It help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to ſay, they were all officers who by divine appointment were to do the work, for we ſay, gifted brethren are alſo by divine appointment to preach; and beſides, the argument is built upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That what others may do, there is no need that any particular perſons ſhould be appointed by God to do, and ſo it will ſtrike at thoſe as well as others.</p>
               <p>If every Church-member of ability may diſtribute to the poor, will it follow thence, that there is no need that any particular perſons ſhould be by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as <hi>Deacons</hi> to do it? If the inhabitants in a Town may give to the poor, yet it is not reckoned needleſs for Overſeers to be appointed to the work. If ſome friends or Relations may provide for an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous child, will it follow that therefore there is no need that any ſhould be put in truſt, as Guardian for it? Surely this doth not follow.</p>
               <p>So, neither doth it follow, that if gifted men may Preach, then it is un-needful, or un-neceſſary that any ſhould be put in truſt with, or have <hi>the charge of the flock committed to them, to feed it with the Word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The truths of the Goſpel are ſuch, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture warrant, are onely to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to others, by ſuch as being faithful and able to teach others, and have thoſe things commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by <hi>Timothies;</hi> and private perſons are not ſuch, to whom ſuch things are committed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is unlawful for ſuch to communicate them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

               </p>
               <p>Hence he taketh notice of ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>According to Goſpel-order, in Goſpel-Churches,

there ſhould be ſome to teach, and others to be taught, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 29 A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is as poſſible that all in a Church may be Officers; for it they be faithful and able, by what rule can any Presbytery refuſe to ordain them? this is as much againſt himſelf as againſt us.</p>
               <p>2. If all were <hi>Teachers,</hi> yet whilſt one <hi>Teaches,</hi> the reſt that hear, <hi>are taught,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 29, 31.</p>

               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It is plain from that place, that thoſe that teach others, muſt be able to teach, and faithful, not</hi> unlearned and unſtable men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That none but thoſe who are faithfull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to teach others, are to preach we grant; and if by unlearned he meaneth men un-inſtructed in Goſpel myſteries, we grant they are to be learned, and no other learning doth this Text require unto preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the things to be committed to them that they might be able to preach, were the doctrines of the Goſpel, which he had heard of <hi>Paul [the things thou haſt heard of me.</hi> &amp;c.]</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We conceive that a committing the truths of the Goſpel which he had heard from <hi>Paul doctrinally,</hi> is intended in this place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word is often uſed only for a <hi>committing</hi> things <hi>doctrinally</hi> to others, as Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> granteth; and ſeeing it will bear this ſenſe, there muſt be ſome ſpeciall reaſon in the Text to reſtain it unto the other ſenſe, elſe an argument from the word taken in the other ſenſe, cannot be cogent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the word is in this place to be taken onely for a <hi>committing Goſpel truths</hi> to them <hi>doctrinally</hi> appeareth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the end of this <hi>committing Goſpel truths</hi> to them is, to <hi>make them</hi> [able] <hi>to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> ſuppoſe there were any ſuch act to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ordination as a committing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by the Ordainers to the ordained, yet this committing of it to them could not make them <hi>able to teach others,</hi> unleſs they will ſay that the <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> are conferred in ordination, which cannot be proved. Nay, they cannot warrantably ordain any, but ſuch as before were <hi>able to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and therefore the ability is not conferred by ordination.</p>
               <p>But this committing is to make men able to teach others, as the words do plainly ſhew, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>The ſame commit thou to faithful men, who [ſhall be able] to teach others.</hi> He doth not ſay commit them to men
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:120096:118"/>
that [are able] at preſent to teach others, as if the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were to be antecedent to this committing the things to them; but <hi>who [ſhall be able]</hi> in future time, or for the time to come; ſo that this committing is to make them able. Many that are faithful, are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed to teach others, and therefore he bids <hi>Timothy</hi> teach them <hi>the way of God more perfectly,</hi> as they did <hi>Apollo, Act.</hi> 18. 26. that they may be able to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And ſo this proveth an argument againſt him. Thoſe that are faithful, and ſo well inſtructed in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths, that they are able to teach others, may and ought to lay forth their abilities that way. But many un-ordained men are ſuch, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe it doth not appear from other Scriptures, that any ſuch committing of Goſpel truths (as he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of) by men, is required unto a call, no not to a call to office: Election and Ordination are both compleat without it. We read not a word of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. &amp; 14. The Lord doth commit the Goſpel to Officers, and make them Truſtees thereof, for ſuch a Church as a man by his laſt Will and Teſtament doth commit his child, and an Eſtate to maintain it with, to ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend: but we find nothing in the Scripture of mans committing the Goſpel to man, but doctrinally <hi>Paul</hi> in a doctrinal way committed that charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. for <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Miniſter before, and therefore this committing it to him, could not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize him to preach.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If</hi> Timothy <hi>were onely to commit them to ſome, that is, to declare them to ſome, and ſet them before their eyes, what means the reſurrection of</hi> faithful men, <hi>&amp;</hi> men able to teach others: <hi>Surely</hi> Timothy <hi>was to preach thoſe truths, not only to ſuch as were faithful, but to ſuch as were unfaithful, that they might learn to be faithful, not only to ſuch as were able to teach others, but to ſuch as were to be taught; therfore it muſt follow, that it is the other committing that is meant.</hi>

               <p>2. That Reſtriction is neceſſary, as well to ſhew that unfaithful &amp; unconverted ones are not fit to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as alſo to ſhew that more then faithfulneſs is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to fit a man to teach others, <hi>viz.</hi> gifts or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as the following words ſhew, they muſt be <hi>[able]</hi> as well as <hi>faithful.</hi> Many <hi>faithful men</hi> are not able to <hi>teach others,</hi> and ſo though they be faithful, yet they need to have Goſpel truths committed to them in a doctrinal way, to render them able for that work; and therefore this doth not make it follow that the other committing is meant.</p>

               <p>Though the Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>de re [teach others]</hi> and not expreſſely, <hi>de modo,</hi> of the manner of performance, authoritatively, office-wiſe, &amp;c. yet the manner muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, elſe it will not help him at all. For ſome teaching of others, he cannot deny to be allowed to ordinary believers, to whom the Goſpel is not committed in that ſence he pleadeth for. He will grant that a private Chriſtian may privately teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it is the teaching publikely by perſons gifted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained, which he oppoſeth. And the Text ſpeaketh no more of that, then of preaching office-wiſe; we may as ſafely read it thus, Who ſhall be <hi>able to teach others</hi> [office-wiſe]; as he may read it thus, <hi>Who ſhall be able to teach others</hi> [publikely.]</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:120096:119"/>
they may prove that they may require it of the Church [to which they ſo preach]. But then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It concludeth not, that they may require a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance when they preach but occaſionally and not conſtantly; which is often the cauſe where many gifted men are in a Church. They cannot all conſtantly preach to the Church in which they [are] as members; there cannot be time or opportunity for them all to ſpeak, or for others to hear conſtantly. There were many brethren gifted in the primitive Churches, as <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. yet it will hardly be proved that they might all require a maintenance of that Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a Church hath many gifted men, and they be deſired to preach conſtantly to other Churches, or to the world, they may require a maintenance of thoſe that are conſtantly taught by them, though they cannot require it of the Church in which they are, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And thus it doth not tie ungifted brethren to maintain all thoſe that are gifted, but onely ſuch as conſtantly preach to them, which is a duty they may be able to perform. If men preach occaſionally at Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may they require a maintenance competent for this? or might thoſe Diſciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 32, 33. require a maintenance for their occaſional preaching. Where there are many gifted men in a Church, they cannot all exerciſe conſtantly, but only occaſionally to that Church, and ſo cannot require a maintenance.</p>

               <p>His ſeventh Argument, That the Churches of Chriſt in all ages have rejected this opinion and practice, we deny. But we are to follow Churches no further then they follow Chriſt, and the primitive Churches we have ſhewn practiſed what we have pleaded for.</p>
               <p>Thus we have anſwered objections againſt the preaching of gifted men un-ordained.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning Election, as belonging to a particular Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſhewed, That Office is a Relation to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and that ſome men who are not ordained Officers, may preach; we ſhall now proceed to ſpeak ſomething concerning the requiſites to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, about which the opinions of men are various, ſome place the eſſence of the call to Office, in Election, others in Ordination. We ſhall paſs over what our brethren in their <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſt. Evang.</hi> lay down, concerning an immediate call to the Miniſtery, and ſhall reply onely to what they ſay, about a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate call. Many Arguments here they level againſt the Congregational way, which we cannot but account a way of Chriſt, and this hath been a great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to us, to this undertaking. The main thing they drive at, is to prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the eſſence of a call to office, doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Election, but in Ordination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it belongeth to a Presbytery to Ordain.</p>
               <p>We ſhall proceed to their Propoſitions concerning Election.</p>
               <p>Propoſit. 1. <q>That the Election of a Miniſter doth not by Divine right belong wholly and ſolely to the Major part of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt.</hi> pag. 127.</note> particular Congregation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To prove this, they undertake to examine the Texts brought for Election, and to ſhew what miſchiefs will (they ſay) inevitably follow from the Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Text for the peoples Election is, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 23. from the choice of <hi>Mathias</hi> into the office of an Apoſtle, by the 120 Diſciples there preſent. Againſt this they have ſeveral Objections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:120096:120"/>
Object. 1. <hi>Thoſe words,</hi> and they appointed two, <hi>do in all probability relate to the Apoſtles, and not to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; it is ſaid, verſ</hi> 17. <hi>he was numbred with us, that is with the Apoſtles, not with the diſciples, and ſo verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>and verſ.</hi> 5. 22. with us Apoſtles, <hi>and then followes,</hi> And they appointed, that is, <hi>the Apoſtles, and not the</hi> 120. <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was the 120. Diſciples that the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was given to, by <hi>Peter</hi> about chuſing an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It was the 120. Diſciples that did chuſe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, purpoſely to put upon a choice, as the ſcope, end, drift and deſign of it, ſhould be directed to 120. and that but eleven of that number, ſhould be intended to be the chuſers; when no Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters are given in the Sermon, to limit it under the 11. ſcundeth very harſh. The exhortation is not given to the 11. more then to the reſt of the 120. as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>In thoſe dayes Peter standing up in the midſt of the Diſciples, ſaid (and the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty, &amp;c)</hi> The perſons ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to were <hi>[the Diſciples]</hi> and the number of the Diſciples is ſaid to be <hi>[about an hundred and twenty.]</hi> And that the Holy-Ghoſt would not paſſe over the hiſtory without mentioning the number (though in a parentheſis) is very remarkable to notifie that the 120. were to act in the choice; becauſe, chuſing was but the yielding obedience to <hi>Peters</hi> admonition; and if all ſpoken to, had not been to act therein, the notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the number had been needneſs, and why was the ſpeech directed to any more then the eleven? It cannot he gathered from the ſpeech that onely the eleven were to chuſe, it doth not ſignifie or give a knowledge that ſome ſhould chuſe and ſome not, and therefore all the 120. were to concur in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no way improper that <hi>[with us, ver.</hi> 17. 21, 22] ſhould be underſtood of the Apoſtles onely, and yet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120096:121"/>
the twelve Diſciples to be intended <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. when it is ſaid <hi>[they appointed two]</hi> For, the former verſes hold out the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> the perſon ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the latter holdeth out the practiſe of the perſons ſpoken to upon the exhortation <hi>verſ</hi> 23. <hi>they appointed two,</hi> now the perſons ſpoken to, were the 120. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. if the queſtion be asked, who appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two? the anſwer is. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>[They] i. e.</hi> They that <hi>Peter</hi> Preached to and exhorted to the work, and that was the 120. <hi>[They] i. e.</hi> the Diſciples, <hi>[they] i. e.</hi> the 120. for they were ſpoken to <hi>ver.</hi> 15. about chuſing, and therefore <hi>[they]</hi> appointed two.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſame perſons by whoſe common conſent <hi>Mathias</hi> was numbred among the eleven Apoſtles, were they that appointed or choſe them: for, it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper that <hi>ver.</hi> 26. ſhould relate to the 120. as <hi>v.</hi> 17. 21, 22. Now, themſelves interpret <hi>ver.</hi> 26. of the 120. they ſay the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> here muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be taken for the general conſent and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole company; and therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 23. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth to the whole company alſo.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>The whole and ſole power of chuſing was not in the people, for they were guided and directed in their choice by the eleven Apoſtles,</hi> verſ. 21, 22. of thoſe men which have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The direction was given before the Election, and therefore the Election might be wholly and ſolely in the particular Congregation not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that direction: if a Miniſter Preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chuſing of Parliament men ſhall tell the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they ought to Elect men ſearing God, &amp;c. or if the Magiſtrate telleth the Electors that the Elected muſt be ſo qualified, will any ſay, therefore the Election doth not belong wholly and ſolely to the major part of the people? So, <hi>Peters</hi> giving a word
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:120096:121"/>
of direction before the choice, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22. doth not hinder the Election from the appertaining wholly and ſolely to the major part of the 120. Diſciples; For the Election was in order of time after that direction.</p>
               <p>2. This would evidence rather that it was the 120. Diſciples, and not the 11. Apoſtle only, that were the Electers; For, will any ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> had a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority or power over the other Apoſtles to limit and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in their choice? did not the other Apoſtles know as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> that one was to be choſen out of that company? it were too Popiſh an aſſertion to ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> had ſuch a power over the other Apoſtles as to guide, direct, limit and determine them in their actings; which muſt be in this caſe, if the guidance and direction were ſuch as hindred the perſons guided and directed from having the whole and ſole power of chuſing. For, it is <hi>Peter</hi> that is the perſon ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (not the eleven Apoſtles as they ſuggeſt.) <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Peter ſtood up and ſaid</hi> and if the Apoſtles had been the onely Electors (and not the 120. Diſciples) then <hi>Peter</hi> had ſuch a power over them; for it is certain, that to whom it did belong to chuſe, them <hi>Peter</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22. how to chuſe; whom ſhould he direct elſe? And if the direction were ſuch as hindred their having the whole and ſole power of chuſing who were guided and directed, then <hi>Peter</hi> was over them; nay, this will deny the other Apoſtles to be the Electors as well as the 120. Diſciples, and then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their firſt objection, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. 21. 22. 23. that ſaith, <hi>they appointed,</hi> that is, <hi>the Apoſtles;</hi> now it muſt not be the Apoſtles neither. But, becauſe it was the reſt of the 120. rather then the Apoſtles that needed direction about chuſing; therefore they were the Electors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. <hi>The people cannot (in any good conſtruction) be ſaid
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:120096:122"/>
to have choſen</hi> Mathias <hi>any more then</hi> Barſabas, for they appointed two, <hi>the truth is,</hi> Mathias was choſen by God himſelf, and by God onely, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is certain that the Diſciples had a ſtroak in this matter, and went as far as any humane ſuffrages could go, where the office was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>They i. e. the Diſciples appointed two.</hi> The Election of two, was given to the Diſciples, one of which was certainly determined ſhould be the Apoſtle. But the Election of the one, or final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination which of thoſe two ſhould be the Apoſtle, this did belong to God onely, and thence chuſing is attributed to God. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Shew whether of theſe thou haſt choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if God onely had not thus choſen him, he ſhould have wanted an Immediate call of God, and ſo had not been an Apoſtle. But the Diſciples did chuſe, and then God choſe alſo.</p>
               <p>And if the Lord would grant thus much to men in the caſe of an extraordinary Officer, let men beware, of abridging the people of this liberty, in the caſe of ordinary Officers, or of making ſuch a light matter as they do of the peoples Election.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond Text alledged for the peoples Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. concerning the choice of <hi>Deacons,</hi> where the whole and ſole power of chuſing is put into the hands of the people; and therefore the choice of a Miniſter belongs by Divine right wholly &amp; ſolely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people. Againſt this they have two objections.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>The people had not the whole and the ſole choice of the</hi> Deacons, <hi>but were herein guided, directed and limited by the holy Apoſtles, they were limited to the number of ſeven, and to the company out of which thoſe ſeven were to be choſen, and to certain qualifications which muſt be in theſe ſeven as we are confident that if the brethren had failed in any of theſe particulars, the Apoſtles
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:120096:122"/>
would have refuſed to have laid their hands upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is plain that the Apoſtles referred the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection wholly and ſolely here to the people; <hi>Ast.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Then the twelve called the multitude of the Diſciples unto them, and ſaid</hi> v. 3. <hi>Look [ye] out among you ſeven men,</hi> v. 5. <hi>And the ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, and (they) choſe</hi> Stephen. What can be more evident? <hi>[the whole multitude]</hi> are ſaid to <hi>[chuſe.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Apoſtles guiding, directing and limiting the choice doth not hinder the peoples having the whole and ſole power of chuſing the <hi>Deacons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe thoſe directions and limitations were antecedaneous to the Election, even in order of time before it, and therefore had no ingrediency into the Election, as any part thereof: a Judge of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize and a Jury have the whole and ſole power of determining caſes, and yet there were Laws and Rules preſcribed before-hand, by which they are to walk, and which they are to obſerve in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
               <p>A Corporation hath the whole and ſole power to chuſe its Officers. Mayor, Bayliffs, &amp;c. and yet there are certain rules and Laws to direct and limit them therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ſame Rules, directions, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, are left in holy Writ to be obſerved in all Elections to whomſoever the power of chuſing doth appertain; and therefore if the Apoſtles guiding, directing, and limiting the choice of <hi>Deacons</hi> did hinder the peoples having it, then alſo it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any on Earth to have the whole and ſole power of Election; for any that are Electors, are under the ſame obligation to walk by thoſe rules in all ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, as much as the people then were, onely they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the directions immediately from the mouth of the Apoſtles, others in ages ſince, receive them mediately, or by the written Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:120096:123"/>
And the people may have recourſe to that word for them now. If they will grant that all other requiſites to Election, belong to the major part of a particular Church, beſides the preſcribing of Rules, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to qualifications, in the choice, it is as much as any that we know of, plead for; Chriſt who is the onely Law giver hath preſcribed theſe in his word already, to whom alone it belongeth; it is a whole and ſole power of Election according to thoſe Rules of Chriſt that is contended for. And it is obſervable that when the Apoſtle writeth to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> he giveth ſuch directions, and limiteth to certain qualifications in the conſtituting of either Elders or Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3 &amp;c. <hi>A biſhop muſt be blameleſs, the husband of one wife, vigilant, ſober, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Likewiſe muſt the Deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Titus</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore if theſe things were written to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as Church officers (as our brethren would have it) then, the whole and ſole power of Election belongeth to no body, neither to the people nor the Presbyters, if a being guided, directed and limited can hinder it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, as the people were guided and limited, 1 <hi>Act.</hi> 6. So then were the Presbyters. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. Yea, if thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were written unto <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> with the reference unto Ordination, then this objection will prove, that the whole and ſole power of Ordination doth not belong to Presbyters as much as that the power of Election doth not belong to the major part of the Church; for, then <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were guided and limited about <hi>Ordination</hi> as well as the people were, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. about Election.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Apoſtles would have refuſed to have laid their hands upon them, if the brethren had failed in any of thoſe particulars; yet at the utmoſt that can prove no more but this, that they ſhould have wanted
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:120096:123"/>
                  <hi>Ordination,</hi> it doth not at all deny that the whole and the ſole power of Election belongeth to the people: Election is antecedent to, and compleat without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and hence it is diſtinguiſhed from it, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. v. 5. <hi>they choſe Stephen;</hi> there is election, v. 6. <hi>When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them;</hi> there is Ordination, and it is diſtinct from, and in order of time conſequential to Election; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Apoſtles had refuſed to ordain them, that could not have denyed the people to have the whole and ſole power to Elect them.</p>
               <p>But in ſuch a caſe it is ſuppoſable, that by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the Apoſtles, the people would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked their firſt, and have made a ſecond choice, when they were convinced that they had failed in the former, and ſo may Churches do now, by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others. And in caſe the people had refuſed to make a new choice, and the Apoſtles had refuſed to ordain thoſe that were choſen, what the event would have been, as that Text doth not, ſo it is not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the preſent queſtion to determine; and how ſuch a refuſal to ordain thoſe that were not qualified according to the word, doth deny the people to have the whole and ſole power to Elect ſuch as are qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Word, we ſee not.</p>
               <p>And where ſuch a failing is, if the Election be rendred fruſtraneous, it ſeemeth to be the want of a due obſervation of Goſpel rules in chuſing, rather then the want of Ordination, that doth make it void. Beſides, whether ſuch an Election be not void with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination, and whether Ordination be not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate without a precedent Election (ſeeing Election is pre-required, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.) are things equally difficult to determine.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But ſuppoſe that the people had the whole and ſole choice of the Deacons, yet it will not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:120096:124"/>
they ſhould have the whole and ſole choice of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, for it is a certain rule,</hi> Argumentum a minori ad majus non valet Affirmative. <hi>It is no good way of arguing to ſay, that becauſe a man is able to do the leſſer, therefore he is able to do the greater. Now the office of a Deacon is inferior to the office of a Presbyter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our brethren uſe the ſame Argument from the leſſer to the greater Affirmatively, and take it from this very inſtance of Deacons. Surely they might take ſuch Coyn, as they pay to others.</p>

               <p>The Argument is the ſame, and as forcible if we apply it to Election; and ſay thus,</p>
               <p>In the very choice of their Deacons, which was but an inferiour Office, the people had the power of Election; much more ought they to have the choice of their Paſtors, who are to be exerciſed in the work of Preaching and diſpenſing Sacramental myſteries, which are ſervices of all others of greateſt weight and worth.</p>

2. An Argument from that which is both leſſer in it ſelf, and alſo in probability, to that which is greater, may not be valid Affirmatively: we grant it is no good way of arguing to ſay, becauſe a man is able to do the leſſer, therefore he is able to do the greater.</p>
               <p>Our brethren are miſtaken, if they think that we argue thus, the people are able to chuſe Deacons, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are able to chuſe Paſtors. That the people have abilitie to chuſe their Paſtors, is not the immediate concluſion of our Argument from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. but, that Chriſt hath granted the people a liberty or power to elect their Paſtors, this is it which we ſtrictly conclude thence, and in the ſecond place we may argue; That becauſe Chriſt hath granted them liberty or power to chuſe their Paſtors, therefore he hath given them ability to do it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are two diſtinct queſtions. 1. whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have abilitie to chuſe their Paſtors? 2. whether Chriſt hath granted the people, or a particular Church liberty and power to chuſe them; It is the latter of the two, which we determine Affirmatively from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. If their abilitie to chuſe their Paſtors be queſtioned, we have many other <hi>Mediums</hi> to prove that by, as <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>The ſheep follow him (i. e.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>for they know his voice, v.</hi> 5. <hi>And a ſtranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voyce of ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 14. 27. Whence it is evident that not only Church-officers, as Paſtors and Teachers, but the ſheep of Chriſt who are to be fed or Taught, even they have abilitie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern whether it be Chriſts voice, or the voice of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which they hear, whether they be ſuch Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they are to follow, or ſuch as they are to flee from, and what can be required more to give abilitie for Election, but a knowledge what Teachers they are to own, and who are to be avoided? our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at other times will grant, that the peoples choice maketh a man their Miniſter, their Paſtor, and how
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:120096:125"/>
could this be, if they had not ability to chuſe? and why is it that they here argue againſt their having the whole and ſole power of Election? if Officers lay claim not onely to Ordination, but alſo to part of Election, it will be next unto nothing that they will leave to the people.</p>
               <p>3. An Argument from the Leſſe to the Greater, in probability or in the cauſes of it, though the thing alſo be greater in it ſelf, yet is valid affirmatively in Divine things: from that which is leſs credible, leſſe likely, hath leſs apparent grounds and cauſes for it, to that which is more credible, more likely, hath more apparent grounds and cauſes for it, is a good way of arguing, and that affirmatively; and therefore it is not a certain rule which our Brethren give, that <hi>Argumentum a minori ad majus non valet Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture is frequent in ſuch arguings, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. v. 26. <hi>Behold the fowls of the Air, your heavenly father feedeth them, are ye not much better then they?</hi> v. 30. <hi>If God ſo cloath the graſs of the field, which to day is, and and to morrow is caſt into the oven; ſhall be not much more cloath you, O ye of little faith?</hi> Luk. 12. v. 6, 7. <hi>Are not five ſparrows ſold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God, but even the very hairs of your head are all numbred, fear not therefore, ye are of more value then many ſparrows,</hi> Luk. 11. v. 13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument from the Leſs to the Greater affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, is urged in all theſe inſtances; from the Lords taking care of the Lillies of the field, and the fowls of the air, which are of leſs value, he argueth that he will take care of his own people, who are of Greater value, or far better then they. From
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:120096:125"/>
earthly Fathers providing for their children, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with a <hi>much more,</hi> that our heavenly Father will provide for his children, things far Greater in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And the ſame is our Argument, from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. If the Lord would have the people have the whole and ſole choice of their Deacons, who were to take care of their bodies and worldly goods, much more would the Lord have the people have the whole and ſole choice of their Paſtors and Teachers, who are to take care of their ſouls; as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, <hi>There are more and more weighty cauſes requiring the conſent of the Church, in appointing Paſtors, then in appointing Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the ſpiritual welfare of ſouls is promoted or hindred, according to the ſutableneſs, or unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Teachers; as the comfort of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life would many times be loſt, if a man ſhould be forced to take a woman to be his wife without chuſing her, or a woman were forced to have a man for her husband that ſhe did not chuſe; yea, though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be gracious that were ſo taken unchoſen: So, the comfort of the ſpiritual life would often be loſt, if ſuch Paſtors were obtruded upon Churches as they did not chuſe, and many temptations they might be expoſed to in the caſe of unſutable Paſtors, more then in the caſe of unſutable Deacons; and therefore the whole and ſole power of chuſing Paſtors, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the Church.</p>
               <p>But you may take it thus; If the Apoſtles would not have ſo much as Deacons made without Election by the Church, much leſs would they have Paſtors ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon them without their Election, or then they would not make them Paſtors without their having the whole and ſole power of chuſing them; and then it is <hi>Argumentum a minori ad majus Negative.</hi>

So, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> may be the <hi>[they]</hi> who are ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

And taking it thus, many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that attend other interpretations will be avoided, and the requiſites to thoſe new Officers, are clearly found in the Text.

               <p n="1">1. Election in its proper place, before Ordination, as it was, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. v. 5, 6. The Deacons were firſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, <hi>And after that they prayed and laid on hands.</hi> So here by the direction of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple firſt choſe Elders in every Church by ſuffrages, or lifting up of hands; and thus the native ſignification
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:120096:129"/>
of that word is retained, and the peoples priviledge preſerved, to whom the chuſing power doth belong; for by their own grant, they could not be their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, their Paſtors, their Shepherds, without their chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, and theſe were to be made their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, their Elders, for ſuch are ſaid to be created in every Church; therefore here was an appropriating of theſe Elders to thoſe Churches, by their chuſing of them, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo aptly expreſsing, ſo undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a requiſite to ſuch a matter as the Apoſtle is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, we wonder that any ſhould offer to vex and trouble the Text, by forcing a ſence upon the word, which the Scripture knoweth nothing of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ordination, which is holden forth by thoſe words <hi>[And had prayed with faſting].</hi> And thus we have removed the objections againſt the Scriptures alleaged for the peoples having the whole and ſole power of Election.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Argument to prove, that the power of Election of Miniſters, doth not by Divine right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long wholly and ſolely to the Major part of every particular congregation, is drawn from the miſchief that (they ſay) will inevitably flow from this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And four miſchiefs they ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>It is certain that every one that is to be made a Minister, is first of all to be tryed and proved, whether he be fit for ſo great an office,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. Let theſe alſo be proved, <hi>&amp;c. theſe alſo, that is, the Deacons as well as the Biſhops: the Biſhop therefore is to be tryed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, whether he be apt to teach, whether he be able to convince gain-ſayers. Now there are many Congregations, wherein the Major part are very unfit to judge of Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial abilities, and if the whole and ſole power were in them, they would ſet up Idol-Shepher ds inſtead of able Shepherds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That perſons ought firſt to be proved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:120096:130"/>
they be fit for ſuch an Office, before it be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them, we grant: <hi>i. e.</hi> A knowledge or good experience, that they are furniſhed with ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as the Goſpel requireth ſuch Officers ſhould have, ought to be attained before Election unto the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If they intend by it, a formal examination imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperiority of the examiners, &amp; the ſubjection of the examined, the Text doth not witneſs that ſuch a probation is required. If a Church by obſervation of a mans converſation, by hearing his doctrine, by its own familiar converſes with him, and others report of him, hath gained a knowledge or experience of his fitneſs for the work; this is all the proving that can neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be enforced hence.</p>
               <p>2. It was referred to the Church to judge of the qualifications of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. v. 3. <hi>Look ye out among you ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghoſt, and wiſdom.</hi> This implyeth, that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcern whether they were ſo qualified or not, elſe it had been in vain to put them upon looking out ſuch. And it is as eaſie to judge of moſt of thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications required to be in an Elder, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. as it was of thoſe required in a Deacon, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. The people are able to diſcern whether a man be <hi>blameleſs, the husband of one wife, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour, given to hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality,</hi> v. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and therefore onely their ability to try whether they be apt to teach, and able to convince gain-ſayers, can be queſtioned; and we have clear proof of a Churches proving Deacons, let our Brethren ſhew as clear proof for a Presbyteries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Elders.</p>
               <p>3. We deſire Scripture grounds to evidence that any true Churches of Chriſt, conſiſt of ſuch members, as the Major part are unfit to judge of Miniſterial abilities: this we deny, and they give us their bare word for the proof of it. This being unproved no ſuch miſchief as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:120096:130"/>
they ſuppoſe, doth enſue upon the peoples having the whole and ſole power of chuſing.</p>
               <p>4. The Sheep of Chriſt are ſaid <hi>to know his voice,</hi> Joh. 10. v. 4. &amp; v. 5. <hi>A stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him;</hi> and this importeth their having ability and liberty to judge what Teachers they are to Elect, and what Teachers they are to reject, and the ſheep of Chriſt who are hearers, are thus to judge of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Surely this implyeth their fitneſs to prove them, both whether they be apt to teach, and able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince gain-ſayers.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>There are ſome Congregations wherein the Major part are wicked, and if left to themſelves wholly, would chuſe none but ſuch as are like themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This will as well deny it to belong to the Elderſhip, as to the Major part of a Church; for, there are many wicked men who are ordained, &amp; ſo are (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our brethrens principles) made Elders, and if they aſſociate, are a wicked Elderſhip, and if left to themſelves, would chuſe and ordain none but ſuch as are like themſelves. Surely our Brethren cannot deny the Election of Paſtors to a wicked Congregation, &amp; yet grant it to a wicked Elderſhip. And if they ſay it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belongeth onely to a good Elderſhip to act therein, we may as well ſay, it belongeth onely to ſuch a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the Major part whereof is good.</p>
               <p>2. We do not ſay the power of Election of Paſtors doth belong to ſuch a Congregation, the Major part whereof is wicked, but to ſuch a Church, the Major part whereof is viſibly godly: if the Major part of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be wicked, we ſuppoſe then it is no true Church. If once it were a Church, yet now it ceaſeth to be ſo, or is unchurched, or elſe the Minor &amp; better part is to be deemed the Church, By Congregations, ſurely they mean Pariſhes &amp; our brethren know that though ſome pleaders for the peoples power of Election, have granted
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:120096:131"/>
that there are true Churches in ſome Pariſhes, yet they never ſaid (that we can find) that Pariſhes taken collectively, are true Churches. Becauſe the major part of many pariſhes are wicked, therefore we deny that they are Churches of Chriſt, or that the power of Election of Officers doth appertain to the Major part of the Pariſhioners. We cannot find that they are in a capacity to have Officers over them, until they be a Church, and ſo are uncapable of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>They ſuppoſe a Church or Congregation ſutable to Presbyterian Principles, and then deny the Election which is according to Congregational principles, to belong to it.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>There are ſome, wherein the Major part poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may be heretical, and will never conſent to the Election of an Orthodox and ſound Minister.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The anſwers to the former objection will ſerve here alſo. Poſſibly a Presbytery may be heretical, and ſo the Presbytery will not conſent to the Election of an Orthodox and ſound Miniſter; they will not deny that an Orthodox Elderſhip may act in an Election, becauſe an heretical one may not; and why ſhould they deny a Church, ſound in the faith, a power of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, becauſe an heretical one hath it not.</p>
               <p>2. Let them prove that the Goſpel owneth any Congregation as a true Church of Chriſt, capable of having Officers ſet over it by a Presbytery, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part be heretical.</p>
               <p>Are not men to be caſt out of the Church for hereſie? did our brethren ever read of a true Church of Chriſt, the Major part of which conſiſted of Heretiques? if not, why do they put the caſe?</p>
               <p>3. By the ſame Argument we may prove, that the power of Ordination doth not belong wholly and ſolely to a Presbytery, for the Major part of that, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:120096:131"/>
may be heretical. Becauſe an heretical Presbytery may not ordain, they will not infer that therefore the whole and ſole power of Ordination doth not belong to an Orthodox Presbytery: and becauſe an heretical Congregation may not Elect Paſtors, why would they infer, that therefore the whole and ſole power of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection doth not belong to the Major part of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation which is ſound in the faith?</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Sometimes there have been great diſſentions and tumults in popular Elections, even to the effuſion of blood, as we read in Eccleſiaſtical ſtory; ſometimes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are deſtitute of Miniſters for many years, by reaſon of the diviſions and diſagreements thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In caſes of want of Paſtors, who can ſhew any Scripture rule to warrant their obtruding Paſtors upon a Church without Election? if diſſentions in Churches be ſinful, a Presbyteries obtruſion of Paſtors upon Churches, would be ſinful alſo.</p>
               <p>2. We ſay with Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> 
                  <q>We never read that diſſentions and tumults did ariſe among thoſe that were Orthodox, in the chuſing of Paſtors qualified according to Chriſts appointment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. If diſſentions and tumults, even to the effuſion of blood, have attended ſome popular Elections, yet they were but accidental to them; the giving the whole and ſole power of Election to a Church, doth not neceſſarily cauſe, but only occaſion ſuch evils; and ſo this is no argument againſt popular Elections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8. Sin took occaſion by the Commandment; yet this doth not ſpeak againſt urging the Commandment. Chriſt is a ſtone of ſtumbling to ſome, and the Goſpel an occaſion of tumults, when it was preached by the Apoſtles, <hi>Asts</hi> 14. 19. the people ſtoned <hi>Paul</hi> for preaching the Goſpel. But this will not prove that the Apoſtles had not power to preach Chriſt and the

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning Election, as Eſſentiall to a call to Office.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeir ſecond Propoſition is, Propoſit. 2. <q>That the whole eſſence of the Miniſterial call doth not conſiſt in Election without Ordination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before we proceed to any Arguments, we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe three things.</p>
               <p>Premiſe 1. That if we ſhould grant that the eſſence of a call to Office doth conſiſt in Ordination, and not in Election. Yet,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This would not overthrow the Congregational way. it would not deny Congregational Churches to be true Churches, for they muſt be true Churches before Officers can regularly be ſet over them, whether by Election or Ordination.</p>
               <p>Nor would it deny Officers in thoſe Churches, to be true Officers of Chriſt, or to be rightly conſtituted; for, Ordination as well as Election is uſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way, and ſo the Eſſence of the call is not wanting there, whether it conſiſts in the one or the other.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if it could be proved to conſiſt in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then one principle of moſt Congregational men would fall, but the way would ſtand ſtill. It is not ſuch an inſeparable principle, as the Congregational way ſtandeth or falleth with it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:120096:132"/>
2. This would not deny the lawfulneſs of gifted mens preaching without Ordination: for, though the Eſſence of the call to Office did conſiſt in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ſomething elſe might give the Eſſence to a call to preach. The written word may warrant gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men in their preaching (though unordained) as well as it doth in their hearing, praying, private exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If Ordination doth conſtitute an Officer that doth not ſpeak againſt the preaching of gifted men, who do not aſſume the Office of the Miniſtery. Unleſſe they can prove all preaching to be an incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, or act of Office; this (if granted) will not forbid their preaching. They are without the Eſſence of a call to Office, yet have what is eſſential to a call to preach.</p>
               <p>Premiſe 2. By <hi>[Ministerial call]</hi> in their Propoſition, we underſtand [a call to Office] and we ſuppoſe ſo they take it, becauſe they reſtrain the very work of preaching to Officers.</p>
               <p>Premiſe 3. That though we deny Ordination to be of the <hi>Eſſence of the call to Office,</hi> yet we aſſert it to be a neceſſary adjunct of ſuch a call; Officers ought not to be wholly, or altogether without Ordination, yet the Eſſence of a call to Office is compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination. Theſe things being premiſed, we ſhall give ſome grounds to evidence, that the whole Eſſence of a call to Office doth conſiſt in Election, <hi>i. e.</hi> with acceptation; and then anſwer the Arguments uſed againſt it. Our Propoſition is this.</p>
               <p>Propoſ. That the whole Eſſence of a call to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, doth conſiſt in Election without Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Election makes a man an Elder that was not one before, then it gives the whole Eſſence of the call to Office without Ordination. But Election makes a man an Elder that was not one before. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Election
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:120096:133"/>
gives the whole Eſſence of the call to Office, without Ordination.</p>
               <p>The Major they cannot deny, it being clear in it ſelf, and alſo becauſe they uſe ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> to prove that Ordination gives the Eſſence of the Miniſterial Office, becauſe (they ſay) it makes a man a Miniſter that was not one before. <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſt.</hi> p. 164.</p>
               <p>The Minor, That Election makes a man an Elder that was not one before, we prove from <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And when they had choſen,</hi> or created <hi>them Elders by ſuffrages in every Church,</hi> &amp;c. Whence we obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Election or chuſing here mentioned, made them Elders who were none before: <gap reason="foreign">

And our Brethren ſay that the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>to chuſe, or to appoint, or to ordain;</hi> and they tell us, <hi>they could cite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Ordination doth not give the eſſentials of the Miniſterial Office, then Election doth: for our brethren ſay, it is agreed on all ſides, that the outward call of a Miniſter doth conſiſt onely in his Election or Ordination. See <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt.</hi> pag. 164. But Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not give the eſſentials of the Miniſterial Office, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Election doth.</p>
               <p>That Ordination doth not give the eſſentials of the Miniſterial Office, we ſhall prove by three Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That which doth not ſet a man over a Church of Chriſt, or commit it to his charge, that doth not give the eſſentials of the Miniſterial office, or of the outward call to Office. But ordination doth not ſet a man over a church of Chriſt, nor commit it to his charge, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ordination doth not give the eſſentials of the miniſterial Office, or of the outward call to office.</p>
               <p>The Major is evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe committing of a Church to ones charge or ſetting him over it, is the formal cauſe of office, and ſo the relation of office cannot have a beeing without it; for, <hi>forma dat eſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is not ſet over ſome Church of Chriſt is no officer of Chriſt; this is the ſpecificating diſtinguiſhing character of Offiers, which differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:120096:134"/>

Wee beſeech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and <hi>[are over you]</hi> in the Lord, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. v. 5. <hi>If a man know not how to rule his own houſe, how ſhall he [take care of] the Church of God?</hi> In theſe places, [being over, and taking care of the Church of God] expreſſe the nature of Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe, If Ordination doth not ſet a man over a Church, or commit it to his charge, then it doth not lay him under obligation to the work of Office, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are any people under obligations to duty towards him by ordination as they are towards an Officer; for a being over them, is that which putteth under ſuch mutual obligations, <hi>Acts</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. They are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>take heed to the flock or Church over which they are made overſeers, Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>v</hi> 7. <hi>Remember them that have the rule over you, &amp;c. v.</hi> 17. <hi>obey them that have the rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, and ſubmit your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> No flock or Church may groundedly challenge ſuch ordinary and conſtant feedings, from any other, but <hi>thoſe that are over it;</hi> and onely thoſe that are over the flock can groundedly challenge this obedience and ſubmiſſion from it; for, the mutual duties are required expreſſeſly under that notion. All in it that are not over it, are required to obey thoſe that are over it, and therefore if Election ſetteth over, and giveth the charge of a Church, then election layeth the perſon elected under obligations to act as an officer, and layeth the Church electing under obligations to the performance of duties towards him as towards an officer. All which may fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that if ordination doth not ſet over a Church, then it doth not give the eſſentials of the miniſterial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or of the outward call to office. The Lord would not command duty towards thoſe that are over a Church as towards officers, if they might be over it and yet be no officers, or not have the eſſentials of an
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:120096:135"/>
outward call to office upon them, which they might, if election ſetteth over, becauſe that may, yea accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to goſpel order ought to precede or go before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, firſt, <hi>The Church did chuſe,</hi> and then, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>They were ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> Our brethren ſay, That it is agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God, and very convenient that they that are to be ordained, be deſigned to ſome particular Church or Miniſterial employment. And a little after they adde, we ordain none without a title.</p>
               <p>So that according to their principles and practices, election may and ought to be Antecedaneous to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And therefore if election doth ſet a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and give him the charge of a Church, then it will follow either that a man may be actually an Officer before and without ordination, and then ordination doth not make a man an officer, or the eſſence of the call to office doth not conſiſt in ordination, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Or elſe, a man may actually be ſet over and have the charge of a particular flock or Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, and yet he actually be no officer, (which is contrary to, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 7. 17.) For, election, and ſo the ſetting over the Church, may be before ordination.</p>
               <p>The Minor, That ordination doth not ſet a man over a Church of Chriſt, nor commit it to his charge, we prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe without Election, a man cannot be over any flock, though he hath ſubmitted formerly to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: if no Church of Chriſt hath choſen him, then he cannot truly ſay of any Church, that he is over it. We ask which is he over? and why over one more then another when he want Election from all? A man that formerly took up Ordination, if by a Patrons unjuſt uſurpation of a power, or by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:120096:135"/>
the peoples withdrawing ſubjection, he be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the flock he was ſuppoſed to be over, or by his own voluntary act he leaveth that people, before any other hath called him, poſſibly he may be a moneth, or a year before a new Election; we ask what Church is he over by his Ordination in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, betwixt his departure from one flock and his coming to the other? If he be over or hath the charge of any Church, then he ought to feed and take the overſight of it, and that ought to obey him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 17. of what Church will he require this obedience? and why of this more then of another? he may challenge a power for the exerciſe of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in that Church he is over, &amp; let him but try to put forth a ſuch power in any Church in ſuch a caſe, &amp; he will quickly find by experience that he is over none.</p>
               <p>If he be over no Church and yet was formerly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, then it is plain that Ordination doth not ſet a man over a Church, or elſe that Ordination in ſuch a caſe is loſt; for ſo long as that which ſetteth a man over or giveth him the charge of a Church hath its continuation, ſo long he muſt needs remain Actually over it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if Ordination doth ſet a man over a Church, then there is a neceſſity of a frequent repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and iteration of Ordination: For, a man by his Ordination can be ſet over onely one particular Church at once, and ſo if he removeth to ten ſeveral places in his life, he muſt ſo often have a new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Our brethren ſtrongly aſſert the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of an Officers removing in three <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Div-Min. pag.</hi> 154.</note> caſes, when he cannot have his health where he is, if he be denyed competent maintenance, and if the glory of God may be in an eminent manner advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:120096:136"/>
Some of theſe caſes may fall out to one Officer. 4. 6. 8. or 10. times in his life, and if he removeth ſo often, either he was ſet over, and had the charge of all theſe Churches (which he removeth to) committed to him, by his Ordination, or not. If not, then Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not that which ſetteth a man over or giveth him the charge of them; for, he is ordained and yet is not over ſome of them. There may be Ordination and yet that be wanting which ſetteth over them. If Ordination did it, then ſo ſoon as ever he was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained he muſt needs be over them, and have the charge of them. If the cauſe actually exiſteth, the effect muſt needs exiſt alſo, and then he ceaſeth not be over that Church which he is removed from; Surely he is as much over that, as he is over the reſt which he ſhall afterward remove to.</p>
               <p>If they will ſay, he is over and hath the charge of ſo many Churches, let them prove it. It doth not ſound like Goſpel order, that one officer ſhould be ſet over many Churches, one Paſtor have the charge of many flocks at one and the ſame time, and this by Ordination but once uſed: their own Arguments in their <hi>Jus Divin. Minist.</hi> againſt Epiſcopacy will forbid this.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If they ſhould ſay that Ordination ſetteth him over the univerſal Church, or maketh him a habitual officer to any or all particular Churches, and the peoples Election maketh him actually an officer to, or ſetteth him actually over them as their Paſtor, their Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This (as we conceive) cannot be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we cannot find one Text of Scripture to prove, that any ordinary officer is ſet over or hath the charge of a Univerſal Church; or that he is over any but a particular Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is not proved that the Goſpel knoweth any ſuch habitual officers: and how in propriety of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:120096:136"/>
ſpeech we can mention an habitual ſetting over, we ſee not. Either a man muſt be actually over a Church, or elſe not be over it at all. Either he muſt actually have the charge of it, elſe not have the charge of it at all. And how a man can be an officer to ſuch a Univerſal Church as they aſſert, and yet be no Officer to any particular Church would be conſidered; a man after his Ordination may loſe his relation to, or may ceaſe to be over any particular Church, either by the peoples rejection or otherwiſe, and in ſuch a caſe, it will be hard to him to be an Officer. He is actually over no particular Church, and ſo muſt be an habitual Officer onely, no actual officer at all; and if Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not make a man an actual officer, ſurely it maketh not an officer at all, for to be no actual Officer, and to be no officer, ſeemeth to us to be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe all that he is over he muſt feed and give an account for, <hi>Act.</hi> 20 28 <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17 He cannot ordinarily feed, nor watch for the ſouls of the Univerſal Church (without neglecting his particular Church) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that cannot be deemed the flock or Church he is ſet over: therefore the ſetting him over ſo many Churches muſt not be by Ordination, or elſe muſt be by a frequent repetition and iteration of it (which we grant though we deny the Eſſence of the Call to conſiſt in it) but this will not agree with our brethrens principles.</p>
               <p>For, if ſuch a repetition and iteration of Ordination be admitted of, then either a man is an Officer only to a particular Church, and as often as he removeth, ſo often he ceaſeth to be an officer, and is made an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer again as often as he receiveth a new Ordination; or elſe Ordination is not an office-making act, for there can be no making of him an officer by iterating ordination, who is made an officer already and hath not loſt that relation; and if the Eſſence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:120096:137"/>
call doth not conſiſt in Ordination, we have what we contend for.</p>
               <p>We may conclude with this,</p>
               <p>Every man that is actually ſet over, or hath the charge of a particular flock or Church committed to him, he hath the Eſſentials of the Miniſterial office. But every man who is Elected by a Church of Chriſt, and hath accepted of the choice (though as yet unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained) is actually ſet over or hath the charge of a particular flock or Church committed to him; for Election with acceptation ſetteth over, <hi>Ergo,</hi> every man who is electd by a Church of Chriſt and hath accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the choice (though as yet unordained) hath the Eſſentials of the Miniſterial office.</p>
               <p>And this is our firſt Argument to prove that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not give the Eſſentials of the call to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. That which by the will of Chriſt, is to be conſequential unto a mans having the whole Eſſence of the call to office, that cannot be intended by Chriſt for the giving the eſſence of that call, or that cannot give the Eſſentials of the call to office. But Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the will of Chriſt, is to be conſequential unto a mans having the whole Eſſence of the call to office. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ordination cannot be intended by Chriſt for the giving the Eſſence of that call, or cannot give the Eſſentials of the call to office.</p>
               <p>The major is evident, for doubtleſs Ordination is to be uſed according to the will of Chriſt; it is Chriſt that inſtituted it, and ſo his will is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Rule about the way and order that it is to be uſed in, and none can croſs his will therein without ſin; and therefore, if by his will, Ordination be to come after a mans having the whole Eſſence of the call, then it cannot give the Eſſence to that call; for that which is conſequential or after in its own production,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:120096:137"/>
that cannot give a being to that which is before it. Unleſſe ordination it ſelf hath a being, it cannot give a being to ſuch a call. If the call to office hath it's eſſence, before ordination hath any being upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, then there is ſomething elſe that giveth the eſſence unto the call, and ſo ordination cannot give it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> we prove from <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them; and when they had faſted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> Whence we obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Ordination was here uſed, in all the Acts of it, and requiſites to it in thoſe dayes; here was, 1. Faſting. 2. Prayer. 3. Impoſition of hands. No other acts are found to be belonging unto Ordination when any mention is made of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them, Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And had prayed with faſting, &amp;c.</hi> So that no Acts were omitted in this that uſally appertained unto Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ordaining of theſe perſons was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential unto their having the whole Eſſence of the call to office; this appeareth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were the perſons here ordained who were immediately called to office by God, <hi>Gal</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, &amp;c.</hi> He had been an Apoſtle by men, if this his Ordination had given the Eſſence to his call to office.</p>
               <p>As Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> obſerveth it implieth a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be mediately and immediately called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Text expreſſely declareth that they were before called to that they were now ordained unto, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>whereunto [I have called them]</hi> Their call was Antecedaneous to this their Ordination,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:120096:138"/>
and ſo received not its Eſſence from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by the will of Chriſt, Ordination is ſtill to be conſequential unto a mans having the whole eſſence of the call to office; this followeth upon the two forementioned particulars; For, here is a plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Ordination as coming after the whole Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the call to office. Now, if this example be a binding Rule to us ſtill, then it is undenyable that by the will of Chriſt, Ordination is ſtill to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential, unto a mans having the whole Eſſence of the call to office. And that this example is a binding Rule to us ſtill; we prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ordainers act herein as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; it is the Rule our brethren give us. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Mini. pag.</hi> 161.</note> If we ſhould not follow the examples of the Apoſtles in thoſe things in which they acted as ordinary elders, we ſhould be left at uncertainties, and every man might do what ſeemed good in his own eyes, which would tend to confuſion, and the diſſolution of the Church; theſe are their own words. Now in this example, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. If they were ordinary Elders, that were the perſons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, then they muſt needs act as ordinary elders, or elſe not as Elders at all, for if they were not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary elders, their actings could not flow from a relation which they had not. If they were extraordinary Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as <hi>Barnahas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> (the perſons ordained) were, (who are alſo reckoned up, and called Prophets or Teachers. <hi>v.</hi> 1.) The Act was ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. The main work was ordinary to which they were ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching of the Goſpel. 3. There is nothing in the Text that doth evidence the order to be extraordinary, any more then the act it ſelf. Its no more ſaid, that the coming of Ordination after the call to office-work is extraordinary, then that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination it ſelf is extraordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:120096:138"/>
4. This order of Ordination after the call to office, doth not (that yet we can find) croſſe any other Text of Scripture, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in faith be concluded that this order is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Enough is ſaid to prove that their acting was Ordinary in this Ordination, and therefore if any will aſſert that this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the order of the act was extraordinary, let them prove it.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe in this example, Ordination had the ſame uſes and ends, as it had when ordinary Officers were Ordained: <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſt. pag.</hi> 160. Our Brethren ſay, That Apoſtolical examples in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good of the Church, and which have a perpetual reaſon and equity in them, have the force of a Rule. And ſurely ſo far as Goſpel examples are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, ſo far they have a perpetual reaſon and equity in them, and if the uſes and ends of this Ordination were ordinary, then this example thereof, hath the force of a Rule. And what extraordinary ends ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable could it ſerve to, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> being the perſons Ordained? Nay, ſeparation for the work whereunto they were called was the uſe and end of this Ordination, as appeareth, v. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired what work they were called to. we may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. v. 17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach the Goſpel. Paul</hi> telleth us that it was the preaching of the Goſpel he was called to, and therefore it was this work that he was Ordained to. His Commiſſion was larger and extended further in reſpect of the perſons who were the objects of it, then ordinary Officers Commiſſions now, but that is not material in this caſe, his Ordination was to the ſame work <hi>(viz.</hi> preaching the Goſpel Office-wiſe) which ordinary Officers are ſtill to be ordained to. And v. 3. They ſent them away, <hi>i. e.</hi> freely let them go,

though they would gladly have enjoyed their labours ſtill, yet they conſented to their departing. We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will think that this ſending a way, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any ſuch Miſſion to preach as they uſually plead for from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. the word will not enforce any ſuch ſending, it is uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 21. <hi>Whether of the twain will ye that I Releaſe unto you? Acts</hi> 26. 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 29. <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy ſervant depart.</hi> So that according to the ordinary uſage of the word, it may be rendred thus <hi>[They Releaſed them, or let them depart]</hi> and therefore nothing can be gathered hence for the belonging of Miſſion to Ordination.</p>
               <p>That faſting and prayer here ſerved to any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ends which in ordinary Ordinations they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not to, cannot be proved, and ſurely the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not in vain, it was not a bare act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the will of God, but they might expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of theſe prayers as well as in any other Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As for Impoſition of hands, that it ſerved to any other uſes or ends, then in Ordaining of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. will hardly be proved.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But if this Ordination had ordinary uſes and ends, and ſo this example may be a binding rule as to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination it ſelf, yet how doth it prove it to have the force of a Rule in its being conſequential to the call to Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When ſo many things are ordinary about an Act, there muſt be ſome ſpecial reaſon to render it probable that other things are extraordinary.</p>
               <p>2. It proveth that the ordinary uſes and ends of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination have their attainment after the call to office, and therefore Ordination hath its place and order after the call to office alſo, If ſeparation to the work of Office, appeareth by this Text to be the prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate end of thoſe Acts which are called Ordination, until a man be an officer he cannot orderly be ſeparated to the work of office; and becauſe the ſeparation muſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:120096:139"/>
be conſequential to the call to office, therefore the Ordination by which a perſon is ſuppoſed to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to that work, muſt needs be conſequential alſo, and ſo it is, an ordinary order, and therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is a binding rule to us in the order as well as in the act of Ordination.</p>
               <p>Ordination here was compleat in its acts, and in its uſes and ends; and therefore the giving the eſſence to the call to office is not the proper uſe, or ordinary end of Ordination. The outward call to office and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination are ſeparable one from the other, for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can attain its end, when ſuch a call to office is before it. And if this will be granted, we have what we contend for in this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>This Ordination might be uſed not for the proper end whereto it ſerved, when ordinary Officers were ordained, but for an example, to ſhew the neceſſity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and it is not ſaid, ſeparate me</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas <hi>for the Office, but for the work whereunto I have called them,</hi> Acts 13. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Some end there muſt be of this ordination, and that it ſerved here onely for an example, or for any other end then uſually it ſerved to, is not proved.</p>
               <p>2. It cannot be an example of the neceſſity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination for the giving the Eſſence to the call to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (which is the thing here contended about) becauſe, that was not given by this Ordination; If the main uſe of Ordination were to give the Eſſence to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial call, then this example failed in the chief thing wherein it ſhould have been exemplary. How could the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> take this as a pattern to ſhew the neceſſity of Ordination unto the giving the Eſſence to a call to Office, when it was not uſed for any ſuch end in the pattern? it could not be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that which was not done by it. If we grant it to be an example of Ordination to the work of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:120096:140"/>
yet that will not prove that Ordination is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the call to office, but rather that it is to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that call.</p>
               <p>3. It is true, it is not ſaid, ſeparate them for the office but for the work, let any prove from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ordination doth ſeparate to the office of the Miniſtry, as Office is diſtinguiſhed from the work. What work was it that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſeparated for? Surely if it were to any, it was to the work of their office, and yet they had the whole Eſſence of their call to office before; and therefore we may grant Ordination to the work of office, and yet deny Ordination to office, or deny it as eſſential to a call to office. This may be an example of the one, and not of the other.</p>
               <p>4. It is not like that the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Ordination, ſo as to need this for a firſt example thereof; And who can think that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhould be with the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> a whole year before this, as <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 25. 26 &amp; 12. <hi>v.</hi> 27. &amp; 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and yet they be ſtrangers to Ordination?</p>
               <p>5. May not we conclude more ſafely, that it is an example binding to the uſe of Ordination after the declared call to office, and onely to the work of the Miniſtery, then they can conclude it to be an example of Ordination to office, ſeeing no call to office was here given by it?</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>But</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officers, and ſo could not have an ordinary or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate call to office by their Ordination, and that may be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſon, why it had not the ſame uſe to them as it hath to ordinary Officers: and beſides this Ordination was by the immediate appointment of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 13. 2. 4. <hi>it was an extraordinary thing, and therefore not ſufficient to ground an ordinary practice upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We cannot yet ſee it proved that ordination
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:120096:140"/>
ſerved to any other uſes and ends when ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were ordained, then now it ſerved to, when theſe extraordinary Officers were ordained: if it attained here all the ordinary ends, that it was intended by Chriſt for, then giving the eſſence to the call to office is none of the ordinary ends of Ordination, for that was not attained here; and ſo, neither the extraordinary office of the perſons ordained, nor the extraordinary call which they had, who were the perſons ordaining, can in the leaſt hinder its ſerving to the purpoſe we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge it for. Let them prove that Ordination attained any other ends (then it did here) when ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were ordained.</p>
               <p>2. The extraordinarineſs or the immediateneſs of the call to ordain them, doth prove neither the order of Ordination after the call to office to be extraordinary, nor its falling ſhort of attaining any of the ordinary ends which it ſerveth to. The Apoſtles had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary call to their office, and yet in the ordaining of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. Our brethren (we ſuppoſe) will not ſay that either the end of Ordination, or the order of it was extraordinary. So upon this immediate call they faſted, prayed, and laid on their hands, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2, 3. yet if the acts were not ordinary, then Ordination it ſelf in the acts of it, muſt be concluded to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ſo to be ceaſed, and as well may the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, uſes and ends of it be ordinary, as the acts.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles had an immediate call to preach the Goſpel, and yet that work is ordinary, and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the ſame ends and purpoſes, by thoſe who have no ſuch immediate call thereunto, as they had.</p>
               <p>And this is our ſecond Argument to prove, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination doth not give the eſſential of the call to office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. From the nature of Ordination.</p>
               <p>Take this diſcription of it.</p>
               <p>Ordination is the ſolemnization of an officers call, or
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:120096:141"/>
the Solemn ſeparation of an officer by prayer and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the work whereunto he is called.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For its general nature, it is [ſolemm Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] 1. Not ſuch as was of the Temple, veſſels, garment in the time of the Law, from common uſe, which would render civil imployment unlawful to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, not onely as hindering their reſign ation to the word and prayer, but alſo in it ſelf by vertue of that Separation, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> was an officer and did Preach, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>ver</hi> 25, 26. and yet was ordained after, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. and ſo he was ſeparated as much from worldly employments, before, as after his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. Nor ſuch as is mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>viz.</hi> A ſelecting or determining a perſon to office, for this is done in Election with acceptation. But as is the Sanctification of creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> meats and drinkes unto not onely a lawful and common uſe, but holy, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 5. ſuch is the ſeparation of an Officer (but more ſolemnly performed) to his ſpecial work, in Ordination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For its Act, it is prayer; this we take to be the Eſſential act of Ordination, or that which giveth the Eſſence to it, as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ordinare, quid eſt aliud niſi orare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are but three things, which ordination can be imagined with any ſhaddow of Scripture evidence to conſiſt of, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Faſting. 2. Prayer. 3. Impoſition of hands: the places alledged for Ordination, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more but theſe three, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for faſting; that is no act of worſhip, but is diſpoſitive to prayer which is an act of worſhip, and therefore faſting though it be a neceſſary requiſite to ſome ordinations, <hi>viz.</hi> of elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 23. yet it cannot be deemed Eſſential, nor neceſſary to all ordinations; we do not read of any faſting at the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:120096:141"/>
of Deacons, it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>And when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> Here was a compleat ordination, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faſting. We ſuppoſe none will aſſert faſting to be an Eſſential part of ordination, if they will, let them prove it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for impoſition of hands, it is queſtionable whether it be ſtill continuing or not. Many think its uſe was extraordinary, and now ceaſed: and it is certain that it was uſed in thoſe dayes for the collation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> the giving of the Holy-Ghoſt was <hi>through the laying on of hands,</hi> as is more plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Alſo it was uſed in bleſſing others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Chriſt laid his bands on the little children, Mark</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>And he took them up in his arms, and put his hands upon them and bleſſed them.</hi> It was uſed with ordination of officers in thoſe dayes, but the end of it might be, the collation or giving of the Holy-Ghoſt, or ſome greater meaſure of its gifts, unto thoſe officers, and ſo it might have onely a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary reaſon for its uſe; neither doth that precept, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit this acceptation of the phraſe; for many that were no officers had extraordinary gifts conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 17. and 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 44. 45, 46, 47. much more might officers receive ſuch gifts; and <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacons <hi>who had hands laid on them, Acts</hi> 6. 6. did great wonders and miracles quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 6, 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. However if impoſition of hands had not ſuch an extraordinary uſe, when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were ordained, yet,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We deny that impoſition of hands was a right or ceremony by which the office was conveyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had hands laid on them,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:120096:142"/>
and yet (as we proved before) no office was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed thereby, for they were officers before, and <hi>ver.</hi> 1. They are called Prophets or Teachers. By this it is plain that its uſe in thoſe dayes when officers were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained was not to put the office upon them. Indeed if this were the uſe thereof, then ſuch as want impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, are no officers, and this would deny many Preachers in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be officers, becauſe it is frequently omitted there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny that impoſition of hands was any Eſſential or integral part of Ordination in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes. <q>Our brethren, when they undertake to prove, that Ordination ought to be with impoſition of hands, yet promiſe that it is not their purpoſe to enquire whether it be an <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Mini. p.</hi> 173.</note> Eſſential part of Ordination without which it is null and void, or an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral part, without which it is deficient and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or onely an inſeparable adjunct. We deny that it was any more then an adjunct, or a conſequential circumſtance, and hence, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>And when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> Not before, nor in the time of praying, but after it, <hi>they laid their hands on them,</hi> this was the laſt. Alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. Prayer, was before it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this did not come in, until the Eſſential part of Ordination was over; ſeeing themſelves durſt not aſſert it to be an Eſſential part of it, either that praying which is Antecedaneous to it, muſt be the only Eſſential act, or elſe Ordination hath no Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al act at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our brethren ſay that it is a Rite and Ceremony borrowed from the old Teſtament, and the place they alleadge to prove its uſe in Ordaining or appointing unto office in old Teſtament dayes, is <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 18. 23. Moſes <hi>did ſo ordain</hi> Joſhua, but its ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. <hi>ver.</hi> 9.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:120096:142"/>
Joſhua <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nun <hi>was full of the ſpirit of wiſdom, [for]</hi> Moſes <hi>had laid his hands upon him, &amp;c.</hi> which intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that there was a collation of the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by <hi>Moſes</hi> laying on of his hands; and therefore if they will borrow it thence, we muſt not impoſe hands until we can confer gifts as <hi>Moſes</hi> did.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing impoſition of hands was no Eſſential part of Ordination, hence (if it were not of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary uſe, to confer gifts) then it was onely a ſign or circumſtance, to declare who the party was, that was ſolemnly ordained by the foregoing Prayer. Let them prove, that it was aſſigned by the Lord to any other end, when it was uſed upon the occaſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. If it were onely a Declarative ſign, then it is a matter indifferent, not neceſſary, nor the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it ſinful, any more then the omiſſion of other circumſtances; then, it is as ſinful to omit lifting up of hands in chuſing officers, becauſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> implyeth that rite, as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth the other, and it is probable that impoſition of hands, was omitted at the Ordaining of thoſe Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. for there is mentioned onely <hi>faſting and prayer</hi> beſides the peoples chuſing by lifting up of hands. If Goſpel examples in things which have a perpetual reaſon and equity in them, have the force of a Rule, as to the Subſtantials of them, yet not as to all circumſtantials, for then Deacons muſt not be choſen under the number of ſeven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeven were choſen and Ordained, <hi>Act</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And if we had many Goſpel examples of chuſing officers by lifting up of hands, yet we ſhould think that it were no ſin to omit that, and uſe ſome other rite to ſignifie a choice, for the Lord hath not bound us up to ſuch circumſtances; and ſo it is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether we uſe or not uſe impoſition of hands.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:120096:143"/>
3. As for prayer, that is the Act which giveth the Eſſence to Ordination: ſeeing it is neither faſting, nor impoſition of hands, that give the Eſſentials to it, hence it muſt needs be prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>when they had [prayed,] Acts</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>When they had faſted and [prayed] &amp;c.</hi> And they that will deny prayer to be Eſſential to Ordination, let them prove what it is when they can:</p>
               <p>Neither is it the end of the praying on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to obtain direction from the Lord whom to chuſe or call into office, as if it were dubious and queſtionable whether any of the perſons ſhould be officers or not; this could not be the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, for they were choſen, before this praying, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>They choſe, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>whom they ſet before the Apoſtles, and when they had prayed, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. They had their call firſt, and prayer was made for them afterward. So that the determination that they ſhould be officers, did precede the praying, yea they were officers before it; And therefore the ends of the praying muſt needs be ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord would give his approbation of the choiſe, and own the perſons choſen as his officers, granting them all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualifications, that may fit them for, and all his promiſed bleſſings of aſſiſtance, protection and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in the work whereunto they are called. A Solemn praying unto God, for theſe ends, on the behalf of a perſon choſen into office, before his entring upon the work which his office obligeth him to, is all the Ordination that the Goſpel own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>And this being Ordination after a long Digreſſion, we ſhall now ſhew, how the nature of Ordination doth forbid its giving the Eſſence of the outward call to office. And two Arguments will ariſe hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:120096:143"/>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. If Ordination conſiſteth in action which is performed to God onely, then it cannot give the Eſſence of an external call to office, from men. But Ordination conſiſteth in action performed to God onely. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ordination cannot give the Eſſence of an external call to office, from men.</p>
               <p>The major is plain, There muſt be ſome external act put forth by ſome men, towards or upon others, elſe it is impoſſible that the being of an outward call ſhould be brought in, by them, upon theſe. It were apparently falſe, to ſay, we gave ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his external call to office, when no act paſſed from us, upon the perſon himſelf; our acting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, on his behalf will not do it; as for example, if a man ſhould Petition the Supream Magiſtrate, for his yielding approbation to a perſons acting in a work he is choſen to, and for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſuch favours to him, as he uſeth to afford unto perſons in ſuch places or offices; it would be concluded that this Petitioning could not give him his call to his office, being no act put forth upon him, but to another for him; either he was an officer before, and onely a confirmation is deſired, or elſe the call to the office is ſtill wanting, and is to be given, not by the Petitioner, but by the Supream Magiſtrate, who is Petitioned.</p>
               <p>So, if Ordination conſiſteth in ſuch an action as is not put forth, upon the perſon himſelf, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God onely for him, then it cannot with any reaſon, be conceived, that it doth bring in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an outward call upon him; eſpecially if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination conſiſteth of ſuch an action as hath no colour of a cauſual vertue in it, to leave the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an office-right upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer: In prayer we refer all to God, in a petitionary way, and nothing is done in or upon a perſon prayed for, unleſſe God
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:120096:144"/>
doth it; our praying for him can make no alteration of ſtate or relation, if any thing be done that way, it is God who is prayed to, that doth it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Prayer is made in a way of Ordination, it muſt be ſaid either, that the perſon was before called by men to office, and then Ordination being frequent, cannot give the call, or elſe that the call from men is to come after prayer, and then let them ſhew what act ſequent to, and diſtinct from prayer, doth give the call. Or elſe it muſt be ſaid that the call to office is given by prayer, and then it is God that giveth the outward call, for prayer is directed to him onely, and ſo we come to Minor; That Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſteth in action performed to God onely; this is evident, becauſe it conſiſteth of prayer as its Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial act (as we proved before) and prayer being a part of worſhip, cannot without Idolatry be performed to any, but God onely.</p>
               <p>And it impoſition of hands (the onely act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ordination put forth upon the perſon choſen to office) did give the Eſſence to the call to office, then, not Ordination it ſelf, but an adjunct of it ſhould give the outward call, yea then the want of laying on of hands would ſpeak the Ordination a Nullity.</p>
               <p>

That Action which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in faith, before an outward call to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hath paſſed upon a man, that cannot give that man his outward call to officer. For, if the call to office be paſſed upon him before, then that Action which followeth after, cannot be ſaid to give it; and no action is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed until it can or may be performed in faith, <hi>for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
               <p>But Ordination is ſuch an action, as cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in faith, before an outward call to office hath
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:120096:144"/>
paſſed upon a man; for, how can one pray in faith, or what warrant hath he from the Word (which is the Rule of faith) to juſtifie his praying to God for his approbation of, and bleſſing upon a perſon in a work of Office, before he can conclude that he is ſo much as outwardly called into that Office, to do that work? if one can groundedly conclude that he is called outwardly thereunto, then he was called before the praying, and ſo before Ordination, which conſiſteth in prayer. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ordination cannot give that man his outward call to office.</p>
               <p>3. In the deſcription of Ordination, we have alſo the Object, and that is [an Officer, or one that is already called outwardly unto Office]</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not ſuch as are only gifted men, we ſee no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the ordaining all Preachers to Office-work. The work of Preaching may be performed by gifted men, but they are not ſo to be ordained, until they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake an Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not perſons to be made Officers, but ſuch as are already Officers, they are the objects of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. We find no rule for ordaining men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make them Officers in reſpect of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call, but they that are actually Officers, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Office, before they are to be ordained, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. They were firſt called, and then ordained, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they did not receive their call from or by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the deſcription we have, the end for which Ordination is performed, and that is the Officers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work whereunto he is called; ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2, 3. their ſolemn admiſſion or induction into the work of preaching, as Officers to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; the obtaining Gods approbation and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, are the chief ends of prayer.</p>

               <p>2. We refer them to our foregoing arguments, where we have brought one expreſs Scriptute to prove it, <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 14. 23. and other reaſons, which by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from Scripture do evince it.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:120096:145"/>
that) was to ſet two before the Lord, but it was God that did conſtitute and appoint <hi>Mathias</hi> to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. In the choice of Deacons, the people nominated ſeven perſons to be Deacons, but it was the Apoſtles Ordination, not the peoples Election, that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and make them Deacons; ſo ſaith the Text expreſſely, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Look ye out among you ſeven men, whom we may appoint,</hi> or conſtitute <hi>over this buſineſs.</hi> The eſſence and ſubſtance of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons call, is placed not in the peoples nomination, but in the Apoſtles Ordination. As for <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. they that did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> were the Apoſtles and not the Churches; it rather proves, that the Apoſtles Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was that which did conſtitute Elders in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We have produced Arguments from other Scriptures beſides theſe, to prove that the whole eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Miniſterial call is in the peoples Election, to which we refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>2. As for the inſtance of <hi>Mathias, Acts</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It holdeth forth as much againſt Ordination gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the eſſence to the call to office, as againſt Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for ſeeing (as they ſay) it was God that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and appoint <hi>Mathias</hi> to be the Apoſtle, hence, it was not Ordination by a Presbytery that did it. And here was an half Election, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>They appointed two,</hi> but not a ſyllable about Ordination, or impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, and therefore this is as contrary to their aſſertion, <hi>that the call conſiſteth in Ordination,</hi> as to ours, that it conſiſteth in Election, if contrary to either.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>Mathias</hi> his not being conſtituted an Apoſtle by the peoples Election be contrary to our aſſertion, that Election gives the whole eſſence of the Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al call, then <hi>Pauls</hi> not being conſtituted an Apoſtle by Ordination, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. muſt needs be contrary
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:120096:146"/>
to their aſſertion, that Ordination gives the Eſſence of the Miniſterial call. There is the ſame reaſon for the one, as for the other; for as <hi>Mathias</hi> was Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet not conſtituted an Officer thereby, ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> ordained, and yet not conſtituted an Officer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and the latter muſt needs be as much againſt them, as the former can be againſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This was but half an Election, and that is the reaſon why it did not conſtitute <hi>Mathias</hi> an Apoſtle, as appeareth, becauſe the chuſing of the one (which was by God) was the conſtitutive act, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. v. 24. <hi>Shew whether of theſe two thou hast choſen,</hi> v. 26. therefore if the people had choſen but one, but <hi>Mathias</hi> onely, that had been a conſtitutive act, but that could not be, for then the call ſhould have been mediate, and ſo he had not been an Apoſtle; but the Lord ſheweth how highly he would have Election eſteemed, in that he would have the people chuſe two, one of which he would conſtitute an Apoſtle, when the call was to be immediate. And indeed, the people might have choſen but one, and yet the call might have been immediate, if Election had not been the conſtitutive act, but in that the Election of the one made him an Officer, it ſtrongly evidenceth that Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that which giveth the eſſence of the call to Office.</p>
               <p>There was a compleat Ordination in all the acts of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. and yet that was not conſtitutive, and that ſpeaks more againſt Ordination giving the eſſence to the call to office, then this can againſt its conſiſting in Election.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for <hi>Act.</hi> 6. there is granted to the people a power to chuſe, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>And the ſaying pleaſed the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and [they choſe] Stephen, &amp;c.</hi> here was not a bare nomination, but an Election <hi>[they choſe]</hi> which is far more then to ſnominate, and frequently expreſſeth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:120096:146"/>
the conſtitutive act of an Officer in Scripture, as <hi>John</hi> 6. v. 70. <hi>Jeſus anſwered them, have not I choſen you twelve, Luke</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>He called unto him his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and of them he choſe twelve, whom alſo he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Apoſtles, Act.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 24. So that the being choſen, made, or gave the eſſence to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate call of Officers, and ſurely this is expreſſed, alluding to that which maketh the mediate call. Chriſts chuſing did conſtitute Apoſtles, and therefore chuſing is that which conſtituteth other Officers. Will any ſay, that Chriſt did but nominate the twelve to be Officers? Surely he conſtituted them Officers, by his chuſing of them. But we ſhall ſpeak more fully to the objection from <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and ſhew how we are to underſtand thoſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>whom we may appoint;</hi> when we anſwer their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about Ordination.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. we have ſufficiently proved before, that they that did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, were the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that this holdeth out, that the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the call is in Election; we referre the Reader to our former anſwers to that objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <q>All thoſe Texts which we ſhall hereafter bring for the aſſerting of the Divine right of Ordination, do prove that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 135.</note> the eſſence of the Miniſterial call doth conſiſt in Ordination, and not in Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there are more and more clear Texts for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination then for Election, and Texts that make it not to be an adjunct, but an eſſential conſtituent of the Miniſterial call.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If they intend, all thoſe Texts which they alleadge to prove their firſt aſſertion, <hi>viz. That Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miniſters is an Ordinance of Chriſt,</hi> p. 157. they are much miſtaken, in ſaying, <hi>that all thoſe Texts do prove the eſſence of the miniſterial call to corſit in Ordin. Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:120096:147"/>
3, 4. is one Text inſiſted upon there, and that proveth that Ordination doth not give the eſſence to the call, for there it did not Other Texts they all eadge to prove that aſſertion ſpeaks of laying on of hands, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. but that this Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands giveth the eſſence to the call to office, they prove not, neither do our brethren aſſert it, when they come to their third aſſertion, which is about lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands.</p>
               <p>If by [all thoſe Texts] they mean, all the Texts alleadged for their ſecond aſſertion, pag. 164. we ſhall ſpeak to them in their place.</p>
               <p>2. They are (as we apprehend) as clear Scriptures for Election as for Ordination. What can be more plain then, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5? <hi>The ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, and [they choſe]</hi> and in regard the Apoſtles there did give Rules to the multitude to regulate their choice, and mentioned divers qualifications that ought to be found in the perſons choſen, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Look ye out among you ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the holy Ghost, and wiſdom, &amp;c.</hi> Hence we conclude, that all thoſe places which largely ſet forth the qualifications of Officers, have reſpect to Election. As for Deacons, when the Apoſtles here laid down their qualifications, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their ſpeech expreſſely to the Church or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Diſciples, and that purpoſely to inable them to make a due Election; and therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy</hi> about the qualifications of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. it cannot with found reaſon be concluded, that his end was to tranſlate the uſe of his directions to <hi>Timothy</hi> or Officers only, when the Apoſtles end in laying down like Rules, upon a like occaſion, was, to help and regulate the people in their choice of the very ſame Officers: if this were his inrent, which example ſhould we follow? the Rules and qualifications about other Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:120096:147"/>
or Elders are not limited in their uſe, more to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and ſucceeding Officers, then theſe about Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, which are undoubtedly extended to the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 3. And therefore we conclude, that theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> not chiefly to order his own practice by, about Ordination, but that he might (as the Apoſtles did) give them forth in a doctrinal way to the people, to order their practices by, about Elections either of Elders or Deacons. And ſeeing the Apoſtles do ſo much inſiſt upon, and are ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the laying forth theſe Rules, the great uſe of which, are to regulate Elections (which are before Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination) hence, there are as clear Texts for Election as for Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. <q>We argue from the nature of popular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Election by the people, properly is nothing elſe but their deſignation of a perſon that is to be made their Miniſter, or that is already a Miniſter to his particular charge: it is not ſimply a making of him a Miniſter, but the making of him a Miniſter of ſuch a place; this appears in the Election of Deacons; all that the people did by Election, was onely to deſign the perſons, and to ſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles, but it was the Apoſtles praying and laying on of their hands that made them Deacons. This likewiſe appears from <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. the peoples taking of men, did not give them the eſſentials of their Office; they nominated the perſons, but it was <hi>Moſes</hi> that made them Rulers. If the people have no Office-power belonging to them, how can they by Election make an Officer, &amp;c? <hi>Nihil dat quod non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet nec formaliter nec eminenter.</hi> Why then did the Apoſtles take ſo much pains to return to <hi>Lyſtra, Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> to ordain them Elders in every Church? <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 21, 23. and why did <hi>Paul</hi> leave <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> to ordain Elders in every City? <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:120096:148"/>
why did they not ſpare their journey, and ſend to the people to make their own Miniſters by Election? can we imagine that they took ſuch pains onely to adde an Adjunct to the Miniſterial call, &amp;c?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Election is more then a deſignation to a particular charge or place; for Election with accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bringeth in ſuch a ſpecial relation as the perſon choſen is over, and hath the charge of the chuſers committed to him thereby: and it muſt needs be an Office-making deſignation which ſetteth a man over thoſe which he was not over before.</p>
               <p>A man may nominate a woman to another to be his wife, and no relation may ariſe thereupon; but that act which ſetteth a man over a woman as her husband, is that which giveth being to a relation, which had no foundation before. So Election ſetteth over a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a Church, and ſo maketh a man an Officer, as well as their Officer.</p>
               <p>2. They conclude beyond their proof, when they ſay, all that the people did by Election of Deacons, was to deſign the perſons to their particular charge, and ſet them before the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>they choſe them,</hi> Acts 6. 5. and we ſhewed before, that chuſing denoteth a conſtitutive act. Neither doth that Text ſay, that, the Apoſtles praying and laying on their hands, was it that made them Deacons. They were (as we ſuppoſe) made Deacons by Election, and the appointing at the utmoſt was but to the work, not to the office of Deacons.</p>
               <p>3. As for <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. we might make a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the peoples Election of Church-officers be not a further act, then here was granted them about their civil Officers; for, the deſignation of the perſons to their particular charge (which our brethren in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection grant is Election) was not till after this nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nay, was performed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> v. 15. Or we
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:120096:148"/>
might tell them what learned <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith on the place, Here the people gave them, and after in <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, that is, made them heads: for when things are done by many under the government of one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal they are ſaid to be done by them or by him, as 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 19. compared with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 19. So 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 11. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 1. with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p>But we rather anſwer thus, The caſes do not run paralell, for <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Supream Magiſtrate and ſo might reſerve ſuch a power to himſelf in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of civil officers, as neither a Presbytery nor a Church can claim about the conſtitution of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical officers: whether it belongeth to the Church by Election, or to Presbytery by Ordination to give the call, yet it is but an outward call that they give to Church officers; a far greater power is put forth in the creating or conſtituting civil officers. Neither Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by a Presbytery nor election by a Church, do anſwer <hi>Moſes</hi> act; onely Chriſts acts in making Churches officers, do anſwer <hi>Moſes</hi> acts in making civil officers, becauſe onely Chriſt is King of his Church, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Supream Magiſtrate over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So that we may ſay it is not Election nor Ordination, but Chriſts act onely, which in the ſenſe of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. doth make Church officers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place will not ſerve at all to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>4. Is is uſual in civil Corporations, for the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (who are no officers) by their Election, to make their own officers.</p>
               <p>It is very uſual for them to Communicate an office power, and to give the Eſſentials of a call, to their Bayliffes and other officers, when yet the Freemen cannot act or exerciſe an office-power, but are in ſubjection unto thoſe officers which by their election
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:120096:149"/>
they give both place and power to; and why then ſhould this be ſuch a riddle to any? Either the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ſuch caſes have office-power vertually or elſe they that have it not either formally (for ſo the Freemen have if not) nor virtually, yet may communicate office-power. If they will ſay they have that power vertually, then ſo hath a Church, and by election may give the Eſſentials of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial call, as well as the Freemen can by election make civil officers to rule over themſelves.</p>
               <p>5. It is well obſerved by ſome learned men, that if the people have not office-power either formally or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, yet they may by election Communicate office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power Miniſterially: they may Miniſterially give what they never had, <hi>viz.</hi> As Miniſtering to him who hath power and vertue of deriving it; as a man not having a penny of his own may give an 100l. if the King make him his Almoner. Thus the Church deriveth office-power as taking the perſon whom Chriſt deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, and out of power will have placed in this or that office in his Church.</p>
               <p>It is very ordinary, for thoſe that are leſſer or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, to communicate a power that rendreth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, greater in place, power, and dignity then the giver of it; thus Free-holders and o hers by chuſing do make Parliament men and Burgeſſes, though they be far inferiour to the perſons choſen, &amp;c. and therefore that rule, <hi>nihil dat quod non habet nec formaliter nec emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter,</hi> is not univerſally true.</p>
               <p>6. It doth not appear, that the main or chief end of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in their journey to <hi>Lyſtra, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> was, to ordain elders: it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>They returned again to</hi> Lyſtra, <hi>and to</hi> Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um <hi>and</hi> Antioch, <hi>Confirming the ſouls of the diſciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith; and that we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of

God.</hi> So that the Confirmation and eſtabliſhment of thoſe Saints in the faith, and the encouraging them to patience and perſeverance ſeem to be the principal ends of their undertaking this journey, and therefore it is a vain queſtion, [why did they not ſpare their journey and ſend to the people to make their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by election?] Though there had not been one Miniſter to be ordained, yet their journey could not well be ſpared, for then the ſouls of the diſciples would have wanted Confirmation, and it is eaſie to imagine that they would have taken more pains then they did in this return, only to have confirmed their ſouls; and their concurrence in Ordination is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as one of the laſt things they did, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and that may be but an Adjunct to the Miniſterial call for all that is yet ſaid againſt it. And it is not made the ſole end of <hi>Pauls</hi> leaving <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> that he ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain elders, for it is ſaid, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders, &amp;c.</hi> If there had been no elders to have been ordained, yet it had been needful that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould be left in <hi>Crete</hi> to ſet in order other things that were wanting, and ſtill Ordination may be but an Adjunct, of the miniſterial call.</p>
               <p>We do highly eſteem of Ordination, as an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt, yet we would not give it a higher place, then Chriſt hath ſet it in, we cannot find that Chriſt hath made it of that uſe to give the Eſſence to the call to office, and we cannot but fear that many do too much magnifie and even Idolize that Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If election gives the Eſſentials to a Miniſter, then may a Miniſter elected adminiſter the Sacraments without Ordination. For as Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> well ſaith in another caſe, He that hath compleat power of an office, and ſtands an officer without exception, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:120096:150"/>
juſtly be hindred from doing all acts of that office: for to be an officer compleat without an office, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleat in his office, yet according to rule to be hindred from doing any thing belonging to his office, implies a contradiction; for its all one to ſay a man is implies a contradiction; for its all one to ſay a man is bound to a rule, and yet by a rule he ſhould not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forma dat operari,</hi> effects depend upon the form, not upon extrinſecal circumſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We deny the conſequence. Although election gives the Eſſentials to a Miniſter, yet it will not follow that a Miniſter elected may adminiſter the Sacraments without Ordination; for Chriſts will is to be our Law; if Chriſt hath required the adding but of an Adjunct before the doing ſome ſpecial works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, no man can do thoſe works without that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. If Chriſt hath pre-required Ordination before the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, what is man that he ſhould ſay, one may adminiſter them without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though that be but an Adjunct to the call unto office.</p>
               <p>That which Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpeakes is onely this, that [he cannot juſtly] be hindred from doing all acts of office, if he hath the Eſſentials of office upon him; and this may be granted, for, if Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth Ordination as Antecedaneous to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the Sacraments, then, he is [unjuſtly] hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred who either refuſeth or is denyed Ordination, He is not according to rule hindred from doing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to his office, but by breaking that Rule, which requireth his ſubmitting to Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The reaſon ſerveth to Maſter <hi>Hookers</hi> purpoſe, but not to our brethrens, in this Argument.</p>
               <p>And upon ſecond thoughts, we ſuppoſe they will not ſay, that one may act in adminiſtrations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Adjuncts as Chriſt hath pre-required unto acting in them, eſpecially ſeeing themſelves durſt not

That this conſequence is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they endeavour to prove, by its being confeſſed by Maſter <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the new <hi>England</hi> Miniſters in ſome of their books.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the whole Eſſence of the Miniſterial call conſiſteth in Ordination (as our brethren judge) will it follow, that a Miniſter is onely a Miniſter to the Univerſal Church to which he is (as they ſuppoſe) Ordained, and that he cannot act as a Miniſter to any other? If ſo, how can he preach to Pagans and Indians, who are no members of any Church, when Preaching is a Paſtoral act in their ſenſe? why may not we extend Paſtoral acts to them that concur not in Election, as well as they may extend them to ſuch as concur not in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But they proceed to the proof of their Minor, and give many reaſons againſt that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Minister can perform no Paſtoral act out of his own Congregation,</hi> (they ſay) is an Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

of Popery the truth were hidden ſince, it is a mercy that within theſe late years, it or any other truth is come to light. As many Authors may be cited, who many hundred years ago aſſerted errors, and yet this will not prove that we are to receive them as Goſpel truths; ſo if no antient Authors could be cited for this, yet that will not prove it to be an error, neither would the citation of many for it, prove it to be a truth, and therefore we muſt <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> for the clearing of it.</p>
               <p>2. <q>Contrary to the practice of the brethren themſelves with whom we <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 138.</note> diſpute; it is acknowledged by all of them, that the adminiſtration of the Sacrament is a Miniſterial act, and cannot be done but by a Paſtor or Teacher; and yet it is ordinary, both in <hi>Old England</hi> and in <hi>New England,</hi> for members of one Congregation, to receive in another Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If we may argue from our Brethrens practice, we may ſafely conclude, That a Miniſter may act as a Miniſter out of his own Congregation.</q>

               <p>2. But we anſwer further, Miniſterial or Paſtoral acts have for their Objects ſome things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſome things that are ſpecial and proper. Some things are common to men as men, as the Word and Prayer, which all men may join or have communion in, unleſs in ſome particular caſe diſinabled. Some things are common to Church-members as ſuch, namely, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Lords Supper, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1. Church-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel and care to be acted towards ſuch, by a more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obligation then towards other men, ſeeing every new relation is a foundation to further Communion.

If the right of a man as a man, be ſufficient to claim the priviledge of hearing with a Church, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether he be of this or that place or Church, then alſo, may not the claim of a conſederate with a particular Church, be ſufficient to a priviledge in breaking of bread, not conſidering whether of this or another Church, for his right is as confederate, not as a member of this or that Church?</p>
               <p>Some things are ſpecial and proper, wherein the liberty and juriſdiction of the Church doth conſiſt, as admiſſion of members, excommunication, Election of Officers, &amp;c. Acts of power which iſſue neceſſarily from the gift or reſignation of every one to another, and to the whole, whereby it is, that common privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are by them injoyed after a ſpecial manner, who have intereſt not onely in the good diſpenſed, but in the power diſpenſing; not in the objects of a Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial act onely, but in the Miniſtery. As, ſuppoſe a Father at ſet times giveth inſtruction to his children, who alſo is a Maſter, and teacheth his Servants, at which times the children and ſervants of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood attend upon him, and receive inſtruction, this man performeth the duty of a Father, and of a Maſter to his own children and ſervants, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him as ſo related, the other partake in the good which is given forth, yet not under thoſe relations which are the grounds of thoſe miniſtrations; for, the ſame man is under ſpecial obligations, to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his children, and to his ſervants, by the Law of the relation of a Father and a Maſter, and is to give inſtruction to his neighbours alſo, by the Law of love or charity; but his omitting or neglecting to give ſuch inſtructions to children, is no breach of the Law of his relation as a Maſter, but of his relation as a Father, and his neglecting to give inſtruction unto neighbours, is no breaking the Law of his relation
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:120096:152"/>
as a Father or a Maſter, but of the common Law of love or charity; and when he giveth theſe inſtructions to his children, he doth not put forth any act of the relation of a Maſter therein, or if he giveth them to his ſervants, he doth not put forth any act of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Father therein, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So, if Paſtors and Teachers do preach and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments to their own flocks which they are over, they act as Paſtors, as Teachers, as Officers to them therein, becauſe the Law of their relation bindeth to ſuch duties towards them, and the failing of them were to break the Law of Office-relation; but if they perform theſe acts to any, not of their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, they do not act as Paſtors, as Officers to them therein; for they ſtand in no ſuch relation to them, and if they refuſe to perform ſuch acts to thoſe not of their own Congregations, they do not break the Law of their relation as Paſtors or Officers, but they ſin againſt the Law of the general office of charity, which bindeth to ſeek the promoting of our neighbours good to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our ability and capacity. And as it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found that O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. <q>It is an aſſertion contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the Scripture tells us. 1. That <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 138.</note> there is a Church general viſible. 2. That Miniſters are primarily ſeated in the Church general viſible, and but ſecondarily in this or that particular Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. <q>That every Miniſter hath a double relation, one to his particular Church, another to the Church ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral viſible; he hath a vertual and habitual power to preach as a Miniſter in any place where he ſhall be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:120096:152"/>
lawfully called. Therefore Miniſters are ſpoken of in Scripture, under a general notion, to ſhew the indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs of their office. They are called Miniſters of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4. Miniſters of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. but never Miniſters of the people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If by Church ſhould be meant, a general viſible Church, yet it would not follow, that thoſe Officers might act in any part of that Church, but onely where they are fixed, as we ſhall ſhew afterward.</p>
               <p>2. If they be never called Miniſters of the people, to be ſure they are never called Miniſters of the Presbytery.</p>
               <p>3. They are called <hi>[Elders of the Church] Act.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 17. which is as much as to ſay, Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>4. The ſpeaking of Officers under a general notion, doth not prove the indefiniteneſs of their Office, or the extent of it beyond a particular congregation; for, if they might not preach or adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to any out of their own congregations, yet it were proper to call them Miniſters, of God, of Chriſt, of the New Teſtament, of the Goſpel, Miniſters in the Lord, and Embaſſadors for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. <q>This aſſertion, that a Miniſter can perform no Paſtoral act out of his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 140.</note> own congregation, is contrary to found reaſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They mention ſeven conſequences hereof.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>Hence it will follow, That when a Miniſter preacheth in his own Congregation, to members of another Congregation, he doth not preach to them, nor they hear him preach as a Minister but as a gifted brother. And that at the ſame time he preacheth as a Miniſter by vertue of his office to thoſe of his own Congregation, and to others of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregation then preſent, onely as a gifted brother,</hi> ex officio charitatis generali, <hi>cut of the general office
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:120096:153"/>
of charity, which to us is very irrational.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by <hi>[as a Miniſter]</hi> they mean [as an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer] then, we ſee no abſurdity in it, to ſay that he preacheth to ſome as an Officer, as under a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them, as over them in the Lord, and at the ſame time preacheth to others not as an Officer, or not as over them, or in any ſuch relation to them. A man at the ſame time may give inſtruction to ſome as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to others as a Maſter, to others as a friend and neighbour, as we ſhewed before. So that a man may act under one relation to ſome, and not under that, but another relation to others, in the very ſame act, without any abſurdity.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <q>Hence it will follow, that when a Miniſter preacheth out of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <note place="margin">Jus Divin. Min. p. 140.</note> he preacheth onely as a private Christian, and not as an Ambaſsador of Christ, and when he acts in a Synod, his actings are the actings of a private Chriſtian; and when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Lecture out of his own Congregation (though it be in a conſtant way) yet he preacheth onely as a gifted Brother. Now what a wide door this will open to private men, to preach publickly and conſtantly in our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we leave it to any indifferent man to judge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We deny that in any of the caſes mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a man facteth as an Officer; his Office-power is not drawn out in his preaching out of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or when he acteth in a Synod, or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Lecture conſtantly in another Congregation. Our brethren have given us nothing to prove, that he acteth as an Officer in any of them.</p>
               <p>2. Yet we deny, that it doth neceſſarily follow, he muſt act as a private Chriſtian therein: if he acteth in a Synod, he may act as a publick Meſſenger, and yet not act as an Officer; for ſuch as are no Officers may be ſent to act in ſuch a meeting, as the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:120096:153"/>
themſelves grant; and though comparing them with Officers whoſe actings are conſtantly in publick, they may be called private Chriſtians, <hi>i. e.</hi> compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, they are not perſons ſo publick in their actings as Officers are, yet they being choſen by a Church (which is a publick aſſembly) to act in a Synod, in a publick work, hence they may not act barely as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians in ſuch works. If the brethren in a Church, act in a Synod (as they did generally at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23.) we ſuppoſe they will not ſay, that the brethren generally are Officers, or act as officers, yet either they muſt grant it, or elſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that men may act in a Synod not as Officers. And then either they act as private Chriſtians, or elſe as publick perſons in thoſe occaſional publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>So when a Miniſter preacheth out of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and when he preacheth a Lecture conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he may be ſaid to act as a publick perſon, becauſe his work is publick; and ſo he acteth, not barely as a private Chriſtian, yet not as an Officer, for then he might be actually an Officer to three or four flocks or Churches, becauſe he may lawfully keep up ſo many Lectures conſtantly, and without aſſerting Epiſcopacy, he cannot be ſaid to be actually an Officer to ſo many flocks at once. As, to the preaching of private men, we have ſpoken to that before.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>Hence it will follow, That when a Miniſter baptizeth a child, he baptizeth him onely into his own Congregation. For if he be not an Officer of the Catholick Church, he cannot baptize into the Catholick Church, which is directly contrary to</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by baptizing <hi>[into a Church]</hi> they mean, a making one a member of a Church by baptiſm, we deny that a Miniſter baptizeth (in that ſence) either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Congregation, or into a Catholick Church;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:120096:154"/>
for if baptiſm giveth admiſſion either into a particular or a Catholick Church, then while baptiſm remaineth valid, the party remaineth a member of that Church, for ſo long as he hath that upon him which giveth memberſhip, he muſt needs be a member, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, <hi>where the form is, the</hi> formatum <hi>muſt needs be.</hi> And then either Excommunication doth make bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm a nullity, and render the perſon who is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, unbaptized; or elſe Excommunication doth not eject a perſon out of the Church, becauſe it doth nullifie baptiſm, which (they ſay) giveth member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>And this may anſwer their Argument, to prove that a Miniſter is a Miniſter of the Church Catholick viſible. <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 139. They ſay, <q>He that can Miniſterially admit or eject a member into, or out of the Church-Catholick viſible, is a Miniſter and officer of the Church-Catholick viſible. But every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, by baptiſm or excommunication, admitteth or ejecteth members into, or out of the Church-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick viſible.</q> Therefore, &amp;c. We deny the Minor; If we grant ſuch a Catholick viſible Church, yet we cannot grant that a Miniſter by baptiſm admitteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Church; for then, if Heathens be converted at a great diſtance from any Church or Officer, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever glorious profeſſion they make, yet they are not to be deemed members of that Catholick viſible Church, until they be baptized, which ſoundeth very harſh, if thoſe belong to Satans viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who are without that Church, as they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in their next objection. And alſo then it will follow, either that Excommunication doth not eject a man out of the Catholick viſible Church, and then the other part of their Minor is falſ, or elſe that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication maketh baptiſm a nullity, and then re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing muſt be aſſerted, becauſe there may be a re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:120096:154"/>
after excommunication upon repentance, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the inceſtuous perſon, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. v. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Or elſe a man may have that upon him, which maketh one a member of the Catholick viſible Church <hi>(viz.</hi> baptiſm) and yet be no member thereof: he may have that which admitteth and giveth the formal being of memberſhip, and yet be no member, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>If an excommunicate perſon be no member of the Catholick viſible Church, then he muſt be re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized if ever he be admitted a member thereof, if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into it be by baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Alſo we deny, that a Miniſter by Excommunication ejecteth out of the Catholick viſible Church; the perſon may eject himſelf out of it (if there be ſuch a Church) by renouncing or contradicting his former profeſſion, which (if any thing) made him a member thereof, before Excommunication, and ſo may loſe his memberſhip in the Catholick Church, before he loſeth memberſhip in a particular Church; or however, he may be ejected with, and not by Excommunication. And how a mans being ejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of a particular Church, by Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould make him no member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick viſible Church, if being ejected out of Office in a particular Church, doth not make a man, no Officer to the Catholick viſible Church, we find not.</p>
               <p>2. We may aſſert, that a Miniſter baptizeth onely [in] a particular Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> only ſuch as are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers [in] ſome particular Church or other, and yet not aſſert, that he baptizeth onely [into] a particular Church, much leſs, onely [into his own congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]. This baptizing [into his own congregation onely] may ſeem to intimate.] that if he loſeth his relation to that particular Church, then he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:120096:155"/>
muſt alſo loſe his baptiſm (which it is ſuppoſed) was onely into that. But if that be driven at, it falleth as heavy upon themſelves, if ſuch a baptizing into a Church were granted; for, then, if a man be baptized into the Catholick viſible Church, if he be ejected out of that (which they ſay he may be by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) then he muſt as much loſe his baptiſm there alſo.</p>
               <p>3. As for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. v. 13. It ſpeaketh of the baptiſm of the Spirit into the myſtical body of Chriſt, not of water baptiſm into any viſible Church at all; for the words are theſe, <hi>[For by one Spirit are we all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one body.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 4. <q>Hence it will follow, That a Chriſtian, who by reaſon of the unfixedneſs of his civil habitation, is not admitted into a particular Congregation, hath no way left him to have his children baptized, but they muſt all be left without the Church, in Satans viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny (as before) that baptiſm admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into Chriſts Kingdom, or delivereth out of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans viſible Kingdome. By vertue of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they are Co-members with their parents of the viſible Church before baptiſm.</p>
               <p>2. Some will grant, that Offiers may baptize in ſuch caſes, by vertue of memberſhip in the Catholick Church, as well as they may baptize members of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular Churches, becauſe baptizing is an act purely Miniſterial in it ſelf, and doth not neceſſarily imply his being over, or being an officer to thoſe it is performed towards.</p>
               <p>3. We rather anſwer thus, that a Chriſtian, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the unfixedneſs of his habitation, yet ought to join as a member with ſome particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or other, and ſo the difficulty vaniſhed: thoſe that joined to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 41. 47. yet were many of them men of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:120096:155"/>
as appeareth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. 9. 10, 11. and though they had no fixed habitations there, yet they liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as members and were baptized at <hi>Jeruſalem, verſ.</hi> 41. when they cannot (by reaſon of the unfixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their habitations) enjoy ſuch conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Church, as they would, yet they are to joyn with ſome Church, and hold as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it as they can, elſe a wide door is open to multitudes to keep from under diſcipline altogether: for, if they offend, what Church can call them to an account, or paſſe a cenſure upon them in caſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy?</p>
               <p>Object. 5. <hi>According to this aſſertion, there is no way left us by Chriſt for the</hi>

                  <hi>baptizing of Heathens, when it ſhall pleaſe God to convert them to the Chriſtian faith. We will ſuppoſe an hundred heathens converted we demand, by whom ſhall theſe be baptized? not by a private Chrictian. To baptize is an act of office. Not by a Miniſter, for a Miniſter (ſay they) cannot perform any Paſtoral act (ſuch as this is) out of his own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Neither can theſe hundred converts chuſe a Miniſter, and thereby give him power to baptive them; for they muſt firſt be a Church before they have power to chuſe officers, and a Church they cannot be till baptized: neither can they joyn as members to any other Church and thereby be made capable of Baptiſme by that Miniſter into whoſe Church they are admitted. For in the way of Chriſt a man muſt firſt be baptized before he be capable of being outwardly and ſolemnly admitted as a member of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. The three thouſand were not firſt added to the Church and then baptized, but firſt baptized and thereby added to the Church, Ast.</hi> 2. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The difficultie of ſuch a caſe (if there be any in it) will be found in their way as well as in ours; for, if an hundred heathens be converted, we may
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:120096:156"/>
ask, by whom ſhall theſe be baptized? not by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, for a Miniſter or officer is ſet in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. not in the world; ſuppoſe it be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick viſible Church that is there intended, yet ſtill the Church is the boundary of Office, it reacheth no further then that, and the hundred converted heathens are no members as yet of the Catholike viſible Church, becauſe (ſay they) perſons are admitted into that Church by Baptiſme; and theſe are not yet baptized. What have officers who are ſet in the Church, to do to perform an act of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to ſuch as are no members of any Church? if they have an habitual power to Act as Miniſters in any place of the world, yet that power extendeth no further then the Church, for then they muſt have a threefold relation, one to the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, another to a particular Church, and a third to the world, and all as officers.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt hath left theſe wayes for the Baptizing ſuch as are converted from heatheniſme to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, either they may joyn as members to ſome Church, and ſo be made capable of baptiſme by the Miniſter of that Church into which they are admitted, Or they may joyn together as a Church, and ſo call an officer who may baptize them.</p>
               <p>We ſee no inconvenience in aſſerting that they may be a Church, before they be Baptized, the onely place alleadged againſt it, doth not ſay that they were firſt Baptized and thereby added to the Church, but the words are theſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. <hi>Then they that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his word, were Baptized, and the ſame day there were added about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> They might be added to the Church, either before, or after baptiſme, and yet all this might be ſaid, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that they were added by baptiſme. Their being Baptized was rather a ſign of being added,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:120096:156"/>
then that by which they were added. Chriſts way is expreſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore, and Diſciple all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> they are to be firſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and then baptized; and a diſciple properly is one in Chriſts School, his Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver</hi> 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1. &amp; leſt any ſhould ſay that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipling of them was by baptizing them, thoſe two are plainly diſtinguiſhed, <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples then John.</hi> Here is a difference put between making a Diſciple and baptizing him. And therefore ſuch converts may orderly become a Church or Church-members, before they be baptized, we have proved that they are not admitted by baptiſme, and themſelves will grant that they are Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers immediately after it, and therefore ſurely their admiſſion is to be before their baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Object. 6. <hi>Hence it will follow, That a Miniſter Preaching out of his own Congregation, cannot Lawfully and warrantably prononnce the bleſſing after his Sermon; for, to bleſſe the people from God is an act of Office, and to be done only by an officer, Nu.</hi> 6. 23, 24, 25, 26 compared with <hi>Revel</hi> 14. 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We do not judge, that the <hi>Levites</hi> did bleſſe as types any more then they did pray or exhort as ſo; nor that bleſſing ſhould ceaſe now Chriſt is come to bleſſe, any more then other acts in which Chriſt is chief, but they were appointed to bleſs as they did miniſter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 8. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 13.</p>
               <p>2. Bleſſing is an act of office (we grant) and to be performed by an officer, but not onely: to exhort is an act of office, yet ſome not in office may exhort as we have proved, and might do ſo under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without offence to the <hi>Levite, Act.</hi> 13, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. we have read that the Jewes had in their Synagogues a Pew or Seat on purpoſe for brethren to ſpeak out of, where they that had any thing to offer, did place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:120096:157"/>
and ſet, until the rulers therein did give liberty of ſpeech; in which Seat <hi>Paul</hi> was noted by them, and not as an Apoſtle but as a brother among them, and they ſent unto him that ſat <hi>viz.</hi> in the Speakers place. In like manner bleſſing is an act of office, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Levites</hi> but not onely, <hi>David</hi> did bleſſe, and he was no <hi>Levite,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 6. 18.</p>
               <p>3. Though bleſſing were to be performed by office onely, yet being an act of a common nature, which all have right in who are bleſſed of Chriſt, it may be put forth by vertue of communion, which caſe hath been already ſpoken to by us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If by [Miniſter] they mean [an officer] we grant the conſequence thus far, that if he leaveth or be juſtly put from that particular charge to which he is called, then he ceaſeth to be an officer, and when he is elected to another place, he needs a new Ordination; we can ſee no inconvenience in granting this conſequence, If by Miniſter they do not mean an officer, then they ſpeak nothing to the queſtion in hand, which is onely about a call to office; we deny that either election or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation giveth the call to gifted men to Preach. But we ſuppoſe they ſpeak of the call to office, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we deny that an officer leaving, or being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly put from his particular charge becomes a private perſon (for by Chriſts allowance he may ſtill act in the publick work of preaching, which may denominate him
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:120096:157"/>
a publick perſon) yet we grant he ceaſeth to be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer when the relation to the particular Church cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. But this ſeemeth to them a very great abſurdity, and contrary to ſound Doctrine, which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove diverſe wayes.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <q>
                     <hi>Becauſe every Miniſter hath a double relation, one to the Church</hi>

                     <hi>Catholick indefinitely, another to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation over which he is ſet. Ordination is to the Eſſence of the Miniſterial office, and not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a particular place or charge. The Reverend Aſſembly ſay that the Miniſtery was given by Jeſus Chriſt to the general Church viſible which they prove from</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. Eph. 4. 4, 5. <hi>compared with</hi> ver. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16. <hi>of the ſame Chapter. Now if Miniſters be ſeated by Chriſt in the Church Catholick as well as in their particular Churches, then it followeth, That they have a Relation as Miniſters to the Church Catholick, and though their relation to their particular Church ceaſeth, yet their Miniſterial relation ceaſeth not, becauſe they were officers of the Church Catholick, and there doth ſtill remain in them a power</hi> in Actu primo <hi>to diſpenſe all the Ordinances of Chriſt, though their call</hi> ad actum ſecundum, five exercitium pro hic &amp; nunc <hi>(as Maſter</hi> Hudſon <hi>phraſeth it) ceaſeth. Even as every private Chriſtian hath alſo a double relation, one to the Church general, and another to the particular place whereof he is a member; and when he removes from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation he doth not ceaſe to be a member of the viſible Church (for then his baptiſme ſhould ceaſe, for every baptized perſon is a member of the Church) but onely of that particular Church: a Miniſter of the Goſpel; when he leaves his particular Congregation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſtill to be a Miniſter, though not their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and needs no more to be ordained a new, then a private Chriſtian to be baptized a new; becauſe neither
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:120096:158"/>
Ordination nor baptiſme do ſtand in relation to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, but to the Church Catholick.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Part of this makes the queſtion, the proof of the queſtion, for, their propoſition is, That the the whole Eſſence of the miniſterial call doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Election without Ordination; and part of the proof is, becauſe Ordination is to the eſſence of the miniſterial office.</p>
               <p>2. Their illuſtration (for a proof it is not) doth run them unavoidably into Anabaptiſme, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cry out ſo much againſt: for, they plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert theſe two things. 1. That if a man ceaſeth to be a member of the viſible Church, then his baptiſme cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. 2. That every baptized perſon is a member of the Church.</p>
               <p>From theſe we conclude, That every perſon juſtly excommunicate is an unbaptized perſon; for, he is ceaſed to be a member of the viſible Church; and (ſay they) when a man ceaſeth to be a member of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, then his baptiſme ceaſeth; and it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the ſecond alſo, for we argue thus,</p>
               <p>Every baptized perſon, is a member of the Church; No excommunicate perſon, is a member of the Church; for, they ſay every Miniſter by excommunication ejecteth out of the Church Catholick viſible. <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 139. <hi>Ergo,</hi> No excommunicate perſon is a baptized perſon.</p>
               <p>If no excommunicate perſon be a baptized perſon, then if upon repentance one be re-admitted into the the Church, he muſt alſo be Rebaptized, or elſe be in the Church unbaptized. And re-admiſſion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repentence is commanded, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. <hi>ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This miſtake of theirs, we ſuppoſe ariſeth from their aſſerting that Baptiſme doth admit or make to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:120096:158"/>
ſtand in relation to a Church; whereas baptizing is not into a Church neither into a particular nor into a general Church, as if that gave a being to a relation unto either; but Baptizing is, to or into the Name of Chriſt; baptiſme is a ſolemn ſign of a perſons taking the Name Chriſt upon him, or of his being engaged under, and to make profeſſion of, and own that Name in all wayes, and for all uſes and ends that it ſerveth to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>baptizing them to or into the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy-Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 8. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And hence, although a perſon be baptized in a Church, yet when he leaves that Church or ceaſeth to be a member of it, yet his baptiſme ceaſeth not. If by excommunication he be ejected out of the Church, yea if he ceaſeth to be a member of the Catholick viſible Church (if there be ſuch a one) yet he doth not loſe his baptiſme, that remaineth as a teſtimony againſt him, as a ſolemn ſign of his engagement for the Name of Chriſt, which now he denyeth: as if a man hath Covenanted under his hand and ſeal to pay an Annuitie, &amp;c. to ſuch a perſon; if afterward he refuſeth to make payment thereof, yet his hand and ſeal will evidence againſt him; ſo will baptiſme againſt thoſe that caſt off the profeſſion of Chriſts Name; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count if a Chriſtian leaveth one Congregation and joyneth with another, yet he need not be baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; becauſe he did not receive baptiſme as a ſign onely of his being engaged for the Name of Chriſt whilſt he walked with that Congregation, but for ever: the caſe is not alike for Ordination for if a man after he be ordained proveth wicked, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, or heretical, he may be excommunicated and depoſed, and loſing his office, he loſeth his Ordination
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:120096:159"/>
eſpecially if Ordination did give the Eſſence to the call to Office, ſurely he hath not that upon him ſtill, for then he might be an Officer of Chriſt, when he is no member of any Church of Chriſt, but he doth not loſe his baptiſm. And beſides, it is not proved, that his Office reacheth beyond a particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas his baptiſm doth.</p>
               <p>3. We deny that an Officer hath a double relation, one to the Church-catholick, and another to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation: the places cited, do not prove that he hath a relation as a Miniſter to a Church-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick; as for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. If a Church-general vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible were intended there, yet it would not follow, that any mans relation as an Officer doth extend ſo much as habitually, or in <hi>actu primo,</hi> to the utmoſt bounds of that Church; for, it may properly be ſaid, There are ſet in the Common-wealth, Juſtices, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, &amp;c. Yet will any conclude hence, that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſuſtain a double relation, one to the Counties wherein they live, and another to the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? or that Conſtables have a double relation as Conſtables, one to the pariſh where they live, another to the Common-wealth, or that they have a power in <hi>actu primo,</hi> to do the Office of Conſtables in all places of the Common-wealth? So an Officer may be ſaid to be ſet in the Catholick viſible Church, becauſe that particular Church to which he is an Officer, may belong to that Catholick-Church, and yet his office may extend no further then his particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may have no relation, ſo much as in <hi>actu pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> to any other Church.</p>
               <p>He cannot be denyed to be ſet in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who is ſet in any one place or Pariſh which is in it; and ſo an Officer may be ſaid to be ſet in the Church-catholick, who is ſet in any particular Church which appertaineth to that univerſal, and yet the office
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:120096:159"/>
may be bounded by that particular Church, may reach no further, and therefore the being ſet in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catholick, cannot enforce a relation as an Officer to to that Church, without which no double relation.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh either</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the myſtical body, one in ſpirit and faith, over which never any were ſet as Officers in the whole, part of it being in heaven when the Apoſtles were on earth; nor in part, if ſo, then with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its own act; not without, for, as office and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is Chriſts gift as our fountain, ſo the Churches call is the means thereof; anſwer of the Aſſembly to the reaſons againſt the inſtance of the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> p. 12. not with its own act, for they that never met, nor can meet unto a Church act, put forth none. <hi>Ergo,</hi> though Officers be given [for] the myſtical Church, yet they have not relation [to] it, as Officers over it in the Lord. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the integral body, which is one by conſent and agreement; as the body of <hi>Antioch</hi> is one, and the body of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is one, the unity of the Spirit to be kept there, &amp;c. We ſee no abſurdity to ſay, God hath given to or ſet in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> this and that Church, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, <hi>for the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> ſc. this and that body. And whatever we have in notion, we can find no Church in exiſtence or action, but muſt be a particular Church; as, it is proper to ſay, Satan perſecutes man, though there be no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick man to perſecute, becauſe he perſecutes this and that man; ſo to ſay, God careth to edifie the Church, the body, though no Catholick body or Church, but this and that particular.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>If a Miniſter, when he removes, or is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his particular Congregation, ceaſeth to be a Miniſter, then it will follow,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That if the Church that called him prove heretical,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:120096:160"/>
and wickedly ſeparate from him, that then the ſin of the people ſhould nullifie the office of the Miniſter; Or</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Church refuſe to give him competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſtarve him out from them, or if the major part unjuſtly combine together to vete him out, that then the covetouſneſſe and injuſtice of the people ſhould make void the Function of their Miniſter. Or</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By this Doctrine there will be a door opened for the people of a City or a Nation to un-miniſter all their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which things are very great abſurdities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſound Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As to the two former particulars, though ſuch Churches do hainouſly ſin againſt the Lord, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit wickedneſs at a great height, and muſt expect that the Lord will reward them according to their works, for ſeparating from and nullifying of the office of ſuch, as Chriſt hath ſet over them, upon ſuch accounts; yet we know not but that in ſuch caſes, the ſin of the people may nullifie the office of the Miniſter, it doth debar him from the exerciſe of his office, and why may it not make void the office? Suppoſe upon taking up ſome wicked principles, they cruelly murther or take away the life of their officer, ſurely he ceaſeth then to be an officer, and if their ſin can nullifie his office in ſuch a way, why not by an unjuſt ſeparation from or rejection of him?</p>
               <p>2. If a peoples ſinful rejection of their officer doth not nullifie his office, we ſuppoſe the reaſon is not becauſe his office-power extendeth beyond that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, but becauſe he is, <hi>de jure</hi> and of right, ſtill over that Church as its officer, though he be hindred by their ſinful actings from the exerciſe of his office amongſt them: as a lawful Prince may by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt invaſion be diſabled for the exerciſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Kingdom, though he yet be the Supream Governour, and may recover his right when he can.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:120096:160"/>
But if a Miniſter voluntarily removeth, or be rejected by the people, when either of theſe are upon juſt grounds, then ſurely the relation between them ceaſeth, and ſo he ceaſeth to be an officer.</p>
               <p>3. As to the third thing, they grant that a peoples rejection of a Miniſter, maketh him ceaſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Miniſter; and this openeth as wide a door for the people of a City or Nation to un-miniſter themſelves, or to leave themſelves without any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as the other aſſertion doth to un-miniſter their Miniſters; &amp; if the people of a City or Nation will be ſo wickedly diſpoſed, as to withdraw ſubjection from, or reject all from being their Miniſters, what advantage can there be in their having the name of office upon them, when they cannot exerciſe their office there? and if they be unjuſtly rejected, and loſe their office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they may become Officers again in other places, as well as if they be but put out from being their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <q>Becauſe there is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to warrant the iteration of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Jus Divin. Min p. 147.</note> in caſe of removal. The Apoſtles went about ordaining Elders in every Church, and <hi>Titus</hi> was left in <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders, &amp;c. but there is no mention made of any command for reiterated Ordination, neither indeed can it be; for Ordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſetting a man apart to the Office of the Miniſtery (as we ſhall hereafter prove) and not onely to the exerciſe of it in ſuch a place, though the local exerciſe ſhould ceaſe, yet his office ſtill remains, and therefore needs not be reiterated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is no Scripture (that we can find) to evidence that a man is an Officer to any more then a particular congregation, and if his office extendeth no further, then in caſe of removal he ceaſeth to be an officer, or becometh no officer; And here;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:120096:161"/>
2. All thoſe Scriptures that warrant the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Officers, do warrant the iteration of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in caſe a man becometh an Officer again to any other Church. As in a corporation, if Bayliffs or other Officers having ſerved their whole time, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no Officers, and afterward the ſame perſons come into the ſame Offices again, the ſame Law that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch ceremonies to be uſed in the inveſtment of all ſuch Officers, doth require the iteration of ſuch ceremonies upon a new entrance into thoſe Offices, though the Law doth not require it under the notion of an iteration. So all thoſe Scriptures that warrant the ordaining of all Church Officers, muſt needs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the re-ordaining of ſuch, as after a becoming no Officers, do take up office a new again, though the Scriptures do not mention it under the notion of an iteration of Ordination, but under the notion of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Officers at their firſt entrance into office. Take it thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Major.</hi> All that aſſume office in the Church, ought to be ordained. All the Scriptures that prove Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Officers to be neceſſary, do prove this; and our brethren cannot deny this Propoſition, unleſs they will give up the whole caſe, and ſay that ſome may aſſume office in the Church without Ordination, and ſurely then gifted brethren may preach without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minor.</hi> But thoſe that remove to take the charge of a new Church, they aſſume office in the Church. For, upon a removal they became no Officers, becauſe their office extended no further then their particular Church, and now they become Officers again, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion. Ergo,</hi> Thoſe that remove to take the charge of a new Church, ought to be ordained.</p>
               <p>When the perſon ceaſed to be an Officer, his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (which was an adjunct of his office) ceaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:120096:161"/>
and then he was conſidered as without Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he taking up office again, is ordained again, becauſe elſe he aſſumeth office without Ordination as really as if he had never been ordained.</p>
               <p>3. If any example could be ſhewn of an ordinary Officers removal from one Church, to become an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to another Church, we do ſuppoſe, it would give an example of the iteration of Ordination.</p>
               <p>4. Ordination is not a ſetting apart to the office of the Miniſtry, but of ſuch as are already Officers, to the work of their office. We do not ſay that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is a ſetting apart to the exerciſe of office in ſuch a place, but to ſuch perſons, or to ſuch a Church; that Church may remove to another place, or meet at a great diſtance from the place where now it is ſeated, yet he acteth as an Officer towards it there.</p>
               <p>5. As for <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2, 3. thus much may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it, <hi>viz.</hi> That when Officers are called by the Lord to the work of office amongſt a people, not before committed to them, or when they take a new charge upon them, they are to be ordained.</p>
               <p>If this example hath not the force of a Rule in the grounds and ends of it, what uſe is it of to us for our direction or imitation? if it doth not oblidge, us to uſe Ordination upon an occaſion of like nature, it is binding (as an example) in nothing: for what may be alleadged againſt its being exemplary in this, will as well deny it to be exemplary in other things, and then why do our brethren alleadge it at all for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination? If Ordination were needful for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> upon their taking a new charge for office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, when yet they ceaſed not to be Officers upon the coming of this new call, but onely had their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inlarged by it, then much more is Ordination needful for ordinary officers, upon their taking a new charge, ſeeing they do ceaſe to be Officers upon ſuch
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:120096:162"/>
removals. If this Ordination of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were (as they ſay) by the immediate appointment of the Holy Ghoſt, that may ſpeak, that in theſe dayes we are not to expect ſuch an extraordinary immediate call to ordain Officers, but it doth not deny it to be a a binding example to us, in all that was ordinary in it. Now it is ordinary for Officers to have a call to a new charge, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had here; and the ends of this praying for them were ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord would afford his ſpecial preſence to, and bleſſing upon them in office-work in their new charge, and therefore it doth warrant the iteration of Ordination, in caſe there be a removal to a new charge.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>If the whole eſſence of the Miniſterial call conſiſteth in popular Election, then will two other great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities follow.</hi> 1. <hi>That Ordination can in no caſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede ſuch Election.</hi> 2. <hi>That there muſt be Churches before there be Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know no abſurdity in aſſerting theſe, but let us hear how they would prove them to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.</p>
               <p>We conceive many caſes may be put, in which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination may lawfully go before Election, we ſhall onely give two inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When an ordained Miniſter removes upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable grounds, from one charge to another, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom he removes, chuſe him not as one that is to be made a Miniſter, but as one already made, and now to be made their Miniſter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When there is a neceſſity of ſending men (as there is now in <hi>New England,</hi> for the converſion of Heathen people) we think it very agreeable unto Scripture rules, that theſe men ſhould be firſt ordained before they be Elected by the Heathen to whom they are ſent. And the reaſon is, becauſe that the converſion of ſouls is the proper work of the Miniſtery. When Chriſt went up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:120096:162"/>
heaven, he left not onely Apoſtles, Prophets &amp; Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, but alſo Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, <hi>for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the body of Christ,</hi> Eph. 4. 11, 12. And the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ordinary Miniſters is to be Embaſſadors for Chriſt, and in Chriſts name or in Chriſts ſtead, <hi>to beſeech people to be reconciled unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where it may be had, there we conceive it is moſt agreeable to the Word, that men ſhould be firſt ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before ſent; hereby they ſhall go with more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſhall have power to baptize thoſe whom they do convert, which otherwiſe they cannot lawfully do, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They grant liberty to preach, as Probationers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ordination, yet here they ſay men cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully baptize, without he be ordained; whence we infer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That according to their own principles, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing is more limited to Officers, then preaching.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That men may act as Embaſſadors of Chriſt, though they be not ordained: for if they preach but once as Probationers, either they act as Embaſſadors of Chriſt, and then Ordination doth not make them ſuch, or elſe there is ſome preaching warranted by Chriſt, not as his Embaſſadors, and then gifted men, though no Officers, and without power to baptize, and though they be not Embaſſadors for Chriſt, yet may preach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They aſſert a Miſſion here, which is no part of Ordination, for they ſay <hi>[it is most agreeable to the Word, that men ſhould be firſt ordained before ſent].</hi> There is a ſending then, which is diſtinct from, and may be ſubſequent to Ordination; and why then do our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſo often aſſert ſending and ordaining to be all one? or how will it appear, that any other ſending is intended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. then this which themſelves grant, Ordination may be before?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:120096:163"/>
3. When an Ordained Miniſter removes upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable grounds from one charge to another, he is to have a new Ordination, but a new Election is to precede this new Ordination. The Goſpel knoweth no difference between making a man a Miniſter, and making him their Miniſter, if by Miniſter they intend an Officer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When there is a neceſſity of ſending men for the converſion of Heathens, we deny that they are ſent forth as Officers, or that they ought to be ordained to make them Officers, before they be ſent. If ſuch as are Officers, and have been ordained, do take a journey and preach unto Heathen people, it is not in the capacity of Officers, for thoſe Heathens are of no Church; but they act as perſons gifted, and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt to lay out their gifts in ſuch publick works, for ſuch ends. The converſion of ſouls is the work of the Miniſtery, not the proper work, ſo as the Lord uſeth none but Miniſters therein; Parents, and Maſters, and Neighbours, may be converting inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as they. Miniſters are lights, not by vertue of Ordination or Office, but illumination and gifts; if men in darkneſs be ordained, yet they are in darkneſs ſtill: Officers are not made lights when made Officers; they were lights before, therefore to ſhine in the exerciſe and improvement of their gifts, and might have been Embaſſadors to the world, though they had not been Officers to a Church.</p>
               <p>Gifted men are Embaſſadors in a general ſence, for Chriſt, and in Chriſts name and ſtead <hi>are to beſeech people to be reconciled unto God,</hi> for (as we have proved) they are warranted and commanded by Chriſt to preach.</p>
               <p>We deſire ſome Scripture-proof, <hi>That Ordination may in any caſe precede Election to Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>It will alſo follow, That there muſt be Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:120096:163"/>
before there be Ministers, which is againſt Scripture and ſound reaſon: we do not deny but that there must be a Church before their Miniſter; but not before a Miniſter: the Church Entitative is before a Church Miniſterial, but yet a Minister must needs be before a Church; for every Church muſt conſiſt of perſons baptized, (unbaptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot make a Church) and therefore there muſt be a Minister to baptize them, before they can be made capable to enter into Church-fellowſhip. Our Saviour Chriſt choſe his Apoſtles for the gathering of Churches, there were firſt Apoſtles before Churches, and afterwards the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders in theſe gathered Churches, and one great work of theſe Elders, was to convert the neighbouring Heathen, and when converted, to baptize them and gather them into Churches; and therefore Elders as well as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were before Churches: And whoſoever with us holds, That none but a Miniſter in office can baptize, muſt needs hold, that there must be ordinary Miniſters before Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that therefore the whole eſſence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial call, doth not conſiſt in the Election of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That a Church muſt needs be before a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or Officer is evident, becauſe if one be made a Miniſter, an Officer, it is to a Church; that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preſuppoſed, before one can be made an Officer to it.</p>
               <p>2. If Apoſtles were before Churches, yet ſeeing their call was extraordinary and Immediate from God, that doth not prove, that ordinary Officers (who are called by men) are before Churches, and the contrary is evident, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>When they had choſen them Elders by ſuffrages in every Church,</hi> &amp;c. the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches muſt needs be before the chuſing Elders in every Church. Neither can it be proved, that theſe were Elders before they were their Elders, or that ever any ordinary officers were before Churches. Suppoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:120096:164"/>
perſons could not make a Church, yet the utmoſt it could amount to, would be but this, that there muſt be a Miniſter before this or that Church, it would not follow thence, that there muſt be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters before Churches in general, or before any Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: for, look upon any Church, and if it be ſaid, there was a Miniſter before this or that Church, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the perſons which it conſiſteth of, we may ſay, then there was a Church before that Miniſter, for he could not be an officer unleſs it were to ſome Church, becauſe Officer and Church are Relatives: if it be ſaid there was ſome Miniſter before that Church, elſe the perſons therein could not have been baptized, we may anſwer, to there muſt be ſome Church before that Miniſter, &amp;c. and ſtill Churches are before Miniſters, until we come to the Apoſtles dayes, if the line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion holdeth ſo far, and if that line breaketh before we aſcend ſo high, then where the ſtop was made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the perſon baptizing was no Miniſter, and that cutteth the throat of the objection, for then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized by one that was no Miniſter, after their baptiſm they might become a Church before any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; or elſe the perſon baptizing was a Miniſter, and then it muſt be ſaid, he was a baptized perſon and yet no Church-member, or elſe a Miniſter, and yet an unbaptized perſon; a Church-officer, and yet no Church-member; for if he were a Church-member, then Church was ſtill before the Miniſter: and how could he become a Miniſter, if a Church were not before?</p>
               <p>If the line of ſucceſſion holdeth to the Apoſtles dayes, their call was extraordinary, and they being the onely Officers that were before Goſpel Churches, it ſpeaketh nothing at all againſt Election of the Church, as giving the whole eſſence of the call to ordinary Officers, and it is the call of ordinary Officers onely,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:120096:164"/>
that this queſtion is about, whether that conſiſteth in Election or not.</p>
               <p>3. That a great work of ordinary Elders was to convert the neighbouring Heathens we grant, but that they acted as Elders in their converſion, we deny: that ordinary Elders did baptize then when converted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their being gathered into Churches, is a thing which they have not given us any Scripture-proof for. A Church is not to ſuffer perſons in it to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, but we conceive unbaptized perſons may make a Church, and then either by Communion with other Churches, or by chuſing and ordaining an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer for it ſelf, perſons in it may be baptized; and thus we may hold, that none but a Miniſter in office can baptize, and yet need not hold that there muſt be ordinary Miniſters before Churches, which to be ſure, the Goſpel ſpeaketh as little of, as of unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſons making a Church. And ſo we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their arguments againſt Election as eſſential to the call to office.</p>
               <p>Two Arguments of Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> they undertake to anſwer, by aſſerting that Officers as ſuch, do ſuſtain a relation to a univerſal Church, and by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the perſons which give being to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as to be their Miniſter; and thoſe which give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as to be a Miniſter, but becauſe neither the aſſertion nor the diſtinction, are proved to have any ſooting in Scripture, therefore we paſſe them over.</p>

And the ſaying pleaſed the whole, and [they choſe.] And, electing or chuſing in Scripture ſenſe doth expreſſe the putting a man into an office which he had not before, as certainly as it can be ſuppoſed that this appointing can do it. As <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>He called unto him his diſciples, and of them he [choſe] Twelve whom alſo he named, Apoſtles &amp;c.</hi> So, <hi>John</hi> 6. 70. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 24. Chriſt did not barely no minate and deſign the Twelve by chuſing them, but conferred upon them an office they never had before, did give them the formality of officers, did conſtitute and make them officers by chuſing of them; and from theſe examples we may as ſafely conclude that the peoples chuſing Deacons was that which made them Deacons, and conferred their office upon them; as they may conclude either from the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>2. But two Scriptures our brethren inſiſt upon to prove that Ordination maketh a man a Miniſter that was none before.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture is <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 3. which they ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with others, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. which ſpeak of appointing unto Government. But they know that the appointing, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. was not unto Government or Juriſdiction over the Church.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:120096:166"/>
Deacons were helps, not Governments, ſerving tables; officers in the Church, not over it, as wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes alſo.</p>
               <p>And can they indeed think that Ordination made them Deacons and Election made them Deacons of that Church, or that they were made Catholick Deacons and ſuch as at <hi>Antioch, Epheſus &amp;c.</hi> might have challenged the overſight of, or power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the poor as thereunto appointed, or officers therein, <hi>vel in actu primo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. That thou mighteſt Ordain; but they will not ſay that <hi>Titus</hi> might Ordain alone, but with a cauſal concurrence of the Elderſhip, we crave leave to adde, and of the brethren of the whole Church, for they faſted and prayed working together in every thing except im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, which is not an Act, but a ſign of Ordination, not neceſſary but left free, ſo Aſſertion of the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland, part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>To appoint therefore is not <hi>pro imperio determinare,</hi> or by vertue of pretended power and authoritie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one to be a Ruler in or over the Church.

               <p>But to appoint in thoſe Scriptures, (if it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note onely faſting, prayer or impoſition of hands after Election) is, to Solemnize a call to office, or <hi>Solenniter approbare;</hi> a Kings Coronation or a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ritual inveſtment may be called the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Magiſtrate.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny their Minor, neither doth all that they have ſaid, prove, <hi>That Ordination is a ſending of a man forth with power and authority to preach the Goſpel, and administer the Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We deny that Ordination and Miſſion are the ſame things: that Text alleadged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Miſſion or ſending, but not one word about Ordination, and therefore it is far from proving that Ordination is a ſending a man forth with power and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:120096:167"/>
authority to preach, &amp;c. unleſs they can prove, that they are all one, (which we conceive they can never do) if an authoritative Miſſion were intended, ſuch as Cryers, Heralds and Embaſſadors have, yet that would not evidence that Ordination giveth power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny that the power and authority to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments, is received by miſſion or ſending. the act of the perſon ſending, doth not compleat miſſion, without the objects to whom he ſendeth. The end of Miſſion is not to give a call to, or juſtifie the lawfulneſs of a mans preaching or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments; but that a Preacher may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the lawfulneſs of his preaching to ſuch a people, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch ſpecifically conſidered, not numerically. As, if a Jew ſhould deny it to be lawful for any to preach the Word unto Gentiles, we may prove it lawful to preach unto the Gentiles, by or from miſſion, becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. This Miſſion will prove it lawful for any particular perſons in any Nation, in any Church, in any place, to be preached to, but miſſion will not warrant any particular Preacher in publiſhing the Goſpel unto ſuch particular perſons, in this or that place. We deny that miſſion giveth a man his Commiſſion or authority to preach; and if the Apoſtles Climax did make it as neceſſary and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as calling upon the name of the Lord, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and hearing the Word, yet that would not prove it. The utmoſt that is ſaid by the Apoſtle is, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>(i. e.</hi> not orderly, not warrantably) preach, except they be ſent, and it may as well be ſaid, they cannot orderly or warrantably preach and adminiſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except they be gifted, except they have thoſe qualifications which are required unto Officers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. v. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. yet we ſuppoſe they will not ſay, that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:120096:168"/>
thoſe gifts and qualifications do give power &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments; if that will be granted, then they give up the caſe wholly, for a man may have thoſe gifts and qualifications before, and ſo without Ordination, and ſo (by that rule) may have power and authority to do thoſe acts although unordained. Such gifts and qualifications are neceſſarily and perpetually required unto Offiers, as well as miſſion, and ſo, by the ſame <hi>medium</hi> that they prove miſſion to give authority to perform ſuch acts, may we as ſtrongly prove ſuch gifts and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to give authority thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We deny that the giving of that miſſion ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. belongeth to any man whatever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be meant of the providential ſending. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Chriſt onely to ſend, it was he that ſaid, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Go,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We deſire ſome Scripture-proof, that it appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a Presbytery, or any man to give Miſſion, if that cannot be produced, then ſending is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which giveth the power and authority to preach, or the outward call to office, which muſt be given by man.</p>

                  <q>That this ſo appears, from 2. <hi>Tim. 1. 6.

                     </gap> is often taken not onely for the grace by which we are fitted for an office, but for an office unto which men are through grace fitted. Thus it is taken, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And thus it is here to be taken, <hi>Paul</hi> by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did not onely declare <hi>Timothy</hi> to be an Officer, and confirm him in that office which he had before collated upon him, by the choice of the people, but he together with the Presbytery, gave him the gift, or office of the Miniſtery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny the Minor, The Texts alleadged do not prove, that Ordination is that which gives the Miniſterial office.</p>
               <p>There are three things that need proof, and if any one of them want it, their Argument cometh to nothing. 1. That by laying on of hands is meant Ordination. 2. That by Gift is meant Office. 3. That this gift is given by Ordination.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is queſtionable whether by laying on of hands here be meant Ordination; for that ceremony was uſed upon other occaſions as well as in Ordination. Laying on of hands was uſed in the Collation or conveyance of gifts, frequently when there was no Ordination, as <hi>Act. 8. 17, 18. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 19. 6. <hi>Timothy</hi> might have gifts conferred upon him, although there were no Ordination, and if there were no Ordination, it is far from proving that the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial office is given thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to us clear, that by Gift is not meant Office; ſeveral reaſons are given by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to evidence this, that by gift is meant thoſe ſpiritual abilities by which he was fitted and furniſhed for his office.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth moſt commonly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:120096:169"/>
ſuch gifts and graces as the Lord beſtoweth upon us, &amp; not office: and without ſpecial reaſon we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede or depart from the common ſignification of a word. They have given us no reaſon to evince that it muſt be taken here for office, and not in its uſuall ſignification, and therefore it is a feeble argument, which hath no better proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The nature of the Expreſſions forbid, that by gift ſhould be meant office; for (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) a man is not ſaid to ſtir up his office that is in him, but to ſtirre up the grace that is in him, being put into office. We are not wont to ſpeak thus, <hi>Forget not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ffice that is in you;</hi> a man is not onely more properly, but more truly ſaid to be in his office; nay, the very nature and reality of the thing requires this alſo; An Office is a relation adjoyned to a man, not inherent in him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The perſon exhorted to ſtir up the gift, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. and not to neglect the gift, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. was <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was an extraordinary Officer, an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. v. 5. <hi>Do the work of an Evangelist, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore his office could not be collated upon him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the people, or by the Presbytery; let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that an extraordinary office could be conveyed by an ordinary Ordination, if not, then by Gift can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant Office; and therefore their Argument is altogether without proof, for, the Miniſterial office is not there ſaid to be given by Ordination; And them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves interpret one of the Texts of extraordinary gifts, uſing theſe words; <q>[If <hi>Timothy</hi> had any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gift that was given by the impoſition of the Apoſtles hands, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 6. Stir up the gift that is in thee, by the laying on of my hands;</hi> as it was in thoſe times uſual for extraordinary gifts to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed]</q> Why in one place of the ſame book, they ſhould underſtand by Gift, extraordinary gifts, and in
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:120096:169"/>
another place, Office, in interpreting the ſame Text, we know not. And whereas they ſay there, <q>That impoſition of hands now, confers as much as the impoſition of hands by the Presbytery did to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> viz. the office of a Presbytery.</q> It is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that an office was conferred upon <hi>Timothy</hi> by laying on of hands, and if any were, it muſt be the Office of an Evangeliſt, for that was <hi>Timothies</hi> office, and ſurely our brethren will not ſay, that the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry office of an Evangeliſt is conferred now by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which muſt be, if by the Gift were meant Office, and that were conferred by impoſition of hands, and as much were conferred now; for ſurely that which made him an Evangeliſt, made him a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If by Gift were meant Office, yet it is onely ſaid to be given <hi>[with]</hi> the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery: it is ſeldom that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth <hi>[by];</hi> and however, it cannot be reſtrained to that ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore no Argument can ſafely or forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be fetched thence, for moſt properly it is rendred <hi>[with],</hi> and that doth not intimate any cauſal vertue, but onely a connexion or concurrence, ſuch as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantial adjunct may have. If laying on of hands denoteth Ordination, and be but a meer adjunct to the conferring of the gift, yet it may properly be ſaid to be given, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery;</hi> and therefore it doth not prove that Ordination giveth the Miniſterial office.</p>
               <p>Their firſt Argument to prove, that <hi>the eſſence of the Miniſterial call doth conſiſt in ordination,</hi> is divided into three parts.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <q>
                     <hi>The perſons that are ſaid in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Ordain, are either Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>

                     <hi>Evangelists, or Presbyters. And
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:120096:170"/>
this is a ſufficient argument to us to prove, that it is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination that conſtitutes the Miniſter, and not Election. For it is not likely, that Christ would appoint his Apoſtles, and his Apoſtles appoint extraordinary and ordinary El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to convey onely an adjunct of the Miniſterial call, and leave the great work of conveying the office-power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common people.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whether it belongeth ſo to Officers to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, as none elſe may do it, we ſhall ſhew afterward.</p>
               <p>2. If onely Officers might ordain, yet that were no proof to us, that Ordination conſtitutes the Miniſter; for, the office-relation which is introduced by the call, or by that which conſtitutes a Miniſter, is a relation to the people or to a Church, and therefore the people or a Church muſt needs convey the office-power; for one relate gives being, and the eſſential conſtituting cauſes to another. <hi>Relata mutuo ſe ponunt &amp; tellunt tam in eſſendo, quam cognoſcendo.</hi> They are not made Officers over, or to the Miniſters that do ordain them, the relation is not between Officers and Officers, but between Officers and a Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and therefore if Miniſters onely may ordain, yet they do not conſtitute the Miniſter thereby; for then Relate ſhould not give being to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And although Ordination be but an Adjunct to the outward call, yet that adjunct conſiſting chiefly, if not onely, in prayer, and the bleſsing and ſucceſs of the Officer in his work, depending wholly upon the Lord, who in Ordination is prayed to for it; hence it is not unlikely that Chriſt would imploy Elders in adding ſuch an adjunct, and yet leave the great work of conveying the office-power as to the outward call unto the people.</p>
               <p>

Object. 2 <q>The ſolemnity uſed in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is, prayer, fasting. and impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Jus Divin.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Ordination (ſo far as man acted in it) did conſiſt in ſuch Solemnitie; and reaſon will rather give it, that the call ſhould conſiſt in ſomething elſe, and that Ordination ſhould be but the Solemnization of a call, and not the call it ſelf; for it is improper to aſſert that a call conſiſteth onely in Solemnities, and that any other acts concurred in Ordination in thoſe dayes, beſides thoſe which they mention, cannot be proved.</p>
               <p>2. Prayer is the chief, if not the onely act wherein Ordination doth conſiſt, and reaſon tells us, that a call muſt go before praying for the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man in a work, which is the fruit and effect onely of the call.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>The blame laid upon</hi> Timothy <hi>if he ſhould lay hands ſuddenly upon any Miniſter, is very great.

Now we may thus reaſon, where the greateſt blame lies for unworthy men coming into the Miniſtry. Surely there must lie the greatest power of admitting men into the Miniſtery, elſe the blame is not juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the greateſt blame is laid upon the Miniſters. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If the conſtituting cauſe of the Miniſterial call did lie in Election, The miniſters may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves and ſay, we do but ordain, we do but give an Adjunct, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That blame is laid upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> if he ſhould
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:120096:171"/>
lay hands ſuddenly upon any man, we freely grant; but that the greateſt blame is laid there, for unworthy men coming into the Miniſtery, they have not proved, neither can we find a ſyllable that way in the Text they alleadge, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. The Apoſtle is not there comparing the acts of Miniſters in undue Ordinations, comparing the acts of the people in undue Elections, and then caſting the greateſt blame upon the Miniſters, and therefore their argument is altogether without proof. <hi>Timothy</hi> is injoyned to lay hands ſuddenly on no man, and therefore he ſhould have ſinned if he had done it; and ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3. the people are injoyned to Elect or <hi>chuſe men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghost and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and therefore they ſhould have ſinned alſo, if they had choſen men that were not ſo qualified, and the blame laid upon the people in caſe they choſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without ſuch qualifications, was very great alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. The people are warned to beware of <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and a great danger is intimated, in caſe they did not take heed of them, they would make a prey upon them like ravening wolves; and ſurely there is a like danger in electing ſuch to be Prophets as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſuch when they are gotten into the place of Prophets, and therefore a great blame laid upon the people, in caſe they elect ſuch, ſo <hi>John. 10. v.</hi> 5, 8. and how doth it appear then, from what they have ſaid, that the greateſt blame is laid upon the Miniſters?</p>
               <p>2. Where Officers are, they are to guide and direct in and about Elections, and if the people erre in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for the want of their guidance, to help them to make a better choice, or if they by laying on of hands do teſtifie their approbation of a bad choice, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt blame may be laid upon the Miniſters, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy men coming into the Miniſtery, yet that will not prove that they have the greateſt power of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men into the Miniſtery: it may prove, that in ſuch
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:120096:171"/>
caſes Miniſters are in the greateſt fault, becauſe they do not by counſels, directions, and perſwaſions, ſeek to prevent ſuch undue Elections, or becauſe they did not waſh their hands of ſuch guilt, by refuſing to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them; but as they may be juſtly and greatly blamed upon ſuch accounts for bad Elections, and yet the chief power of Election doth not reſide in them, ſo they may be more blamed for yielding approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch undue Elections by ordaining, or laying hands on them (whereby they involve themſelves in their guilt, and make themſelves acceſſary to their ſin, as really as if the whole power of Election reſided in them) and yet the chiefeſt power of admitting men into the Miniſtery may not lie in the Miniſters, but in the people: and therefore in undue Ordinations the Miniſters cannot (as they would intimate) well excuſe themſelves, and ſay, that they do but give an adjunct, for by adding ſuch an adjunct, they eſpouſe the peoples ſinful act in making a corrupt choice, and ſo become as guilty, if not more guilty them the people. They have power to ſuſpend their own acting in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they have not power (but by counſel and perſwaſion) to hinder the peoples acting in an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Election.</p>
               <p>Thus much in anſwer to the Arguments alleadged for the proving that the eſſence of the Miniſterial call conſiſteth in Ordination.</p>
               <p>If any would place the eſſence of the call partly in Election, and partly in Ordination, they muſt hold as we do, That a man is an Officer to a particular Church or Congregation onely: For, ſo often as a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth from a particular Congregation, ſo often he loſeth Election, which (that aſſertion ſaith) is part of the eſſence of the call to office, and therefore muſt needs wholly ceaſe to be an Officer, <hi>toties quoties;</hi> for, take away any part of the eſſence of a thing, and that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:120096:172"/>
thing can no longer ſubſiſt. That is denyed to be of the Eſſence or being of a thing, which it can ſubſiſt or have a being without. It is a contradiction to ſay that Election is part of the Eſſence of the call to office, and yet a mans call to office can ſubſiſt without Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is as much as to ſay, Election is of the being of a call to office, and yet is not of the being of it, for that call can have a being without it. Therefore if Election giveth part of the Eſſence of a call to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then ſo often as a man removeth and ſo looſeth his Election, ſo often he ceaſeth to be an officer, and ſo often as Election is iterated ſo often he is made an officer, again, and then there muſt be an iteration of Ordination alſo.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, That Ordination giveth the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the call to be a Miniſter, and Election giveth the Eſſence of the call to be their Miniſter; we deſire they would prove their diſtinction to be Scriptural; and then it would follow, That a man may be their Miniſter, before he be a Miniſter, for he may have Election before Ordination, <hi>Act. 6. ver.</hi> 5, 6. and alſo, then a man may be a Miniſter, an officer, and yet not be their Miniſter, or have none that he can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably challenge a power over as an officer, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire obedience from, towards him as an officer; for he may loſe his relation to the particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he was over, and all Congregations, either becauſe they have Paſtors of their own, or upon other accounts, may deny him leave or liberty to put forth acts of office amongſt them. It is contrary not onely to thoſe rules that require duty from them as officers, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. but alſo contrary to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of office, which conſiſteth in a being over ſome or other; in ſuch a caſe there muſt be overſeers and yet none to be overſeen, &amp;c. we conclude therefore that the Eſſence of the call to office doth conſiſt in election and not in Ordination.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is proved that Ordination doth not ſo belong to a Presbytery, but that a Church or the people may in ſome caſes lawfully act in it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <q>Our Brethren proceed to a Third Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 170.</note> of Miniſters ought to be by prayer, faſting and impoſition of hands, And their chief drift in this, is to prove, that Ordination ought to be with impoſition of hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe we have ſpoken briefly to that already, and ſhewed that it is like laying on of hands was, of extraordinary uſe, for the conveyance of gifts, or onely an indifferent ſignificant Ceremony to declare who the party was, that was ſolemnly ordained, and ſo may without ſin be omitted, or the end of it may be attained without its uſe; by ſome other ſign it may be declared who the perſon is; alſo becauſe themſelves do not aſſert it to be any more then an inſeparable Adjunct to Ordination, therefore we ſhall not ſpend time about this, onely take a Rule, which may ſerve as part of an anſwer to moſt, if not all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for impoſition of hands. <hi>viz.</hi> That it is uſual in Scripture to expreſſe things, by that which is neither neceſſary nor of conſtant uſe about them, So <hi>[Chain]</hi> is put for bondage and ſuffering, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>I am bound with this chain, Jud. ver.</hi> 6. <hi>[Key]</hi> is put for power, authority, Government, <hi>Iſai. 22 ver. 21, 22. [Rod]</hi> is put for correction, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 21. Prov. 13. 24. [The croſſe]</hi> is put for ſuffering and perſecution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. A chain is not neceſſarily or conſtantly uſed in bondage; nor a key, in the exerciſe of power or Government, nor a rod in correction, nor a croſſe in perſecution,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:120096:173"/>
yet becauſe ſometimes ſuch inſtruments were uſed in ſuch caſes, therefore the Holy-Ghoſt expreſſeth thoſe things by them: So, though impoſition of hands be neither of neceſſary, nor of conſtant uſe about Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet the whole of Ordination may be expreſſed by it, hence, <hi>Pauls</hi> forbidding <hi>Timothy</hi> to lay hands ſuddenly, doth not imply that it was his duty to lay on hands, or that he muſt neceſſarily and conſtantly uſe that ceremony, but that it was duty to ordain men, which they aſſert to be the thing notified by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing n of hands, which anſwers their ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo the whole work of Ordination may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the ceremony of impoſition of hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. and yet it may not be of neceſſary and conſtant uſe about it, any more then in the former inſtances, the putting a chain for bondage, and key for the whole of Government, and rod for all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and croſſe for all afflictions, &amp;c. will imply that they neceſſarily and conſtantly belong to them, which anſwers their third and fourth Arguments. It is ſufficient that impoſition of hands was ſometimes uſed about Ordination to render the whole of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thereby; but it doth not prove the conſtant uſe of the ceremony to be neceſſary, but only of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the thing ſignified by that ceremony.</p>
               <p>We proceed to their fourth Aſſertion. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Ordination of Miniſters ought to be by the laying on of the hands of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 181.</note> the Presbytery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After a brief explication of the word Presbytery, &amp;c. they come to that which (as they tell us) they eſpecially aim at in this fourth Aſſertion, and they give it under this following Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Propoſ. <hi>That Ordination of Miniſters doth belong to Church officers, and not to a Church without officers. And that Ordination by people without Miniſters is a pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:120096:173"/>
of the Ordinance, and of no more force then baptiſme by a midwife, or conſecration of the Lords Supper by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall give ſome Arguments to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and validity of the peoples Ordination, and then anſwer their arguments againſt it.</p>
               <p>Our Propoſition is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> That in a Church which hath no officer or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in it, ſome believers may lawfully or warrantably ordain, without officers. We ſay [in a Church that hath no officers] for if a Church hath officers in it, they may go before the Church in Ordination, as well as in Praying on other occaſions and Preaching, &amp;c. that onely officers muſt act in it in ſuch a caſe is not clear to us, as ſuppoſe a Church hath but two officers in it, we do not ſee any neceſſity that the whole work of the day muſt lie upon them onely, but [ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers] <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as have moſt of the ſpirit of Prayer, being deſired, may lend aſſiſtance; but whether that may be or not, it is ſufficient to our preſent purpoſe, and to any caſe that neceſſarily falleth out, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way, if it can be proved, that when a Church hath no officers of its own then ſome believers being deputed or choſen thereunto by the Church may ordain, without the neceſſary concurrence of any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>And we ſay ſome believers [may] ordain without officers, not [muſt] for we do not reckon Ordination an act of Government, and therefore Churches may (for ought we yet ſee) hold communion each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it, as well as in ſolemn prayer upon upon any other occaſion, and ſo officers of other Churches may act in it, yet not <hi>qua</hi> officers, but <hi>qua</hi> gifted, and men gifted may without any officers, ordain; for it is a matter wherein the Church hath its liberty who it will depute thereunto, when it wanteth officers,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:120096:174"/>
and it is not neceſſarily confined to officers, as if none elſe might act in it, If a Church hath officers, the Law of their relation to the Church putteth them under obligations to go before the Church in Ordination, as well as in other duties as Preaching, adminiſtring of the Sacraments, &amp;c. and therefore where officers are in a Church, they act as officers in Ordination as well as they do in prayer upon other ſolemn occaſions, wherein undoubtedly other Chriſtians eminently giſted may act in Prayer, yet do it not as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>This is our ſenſe of the queſtion, yet becauſe our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do account Ordination to be an act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea an eminent act of juriſdiction, therefore if in ſome of our Arguments may ſeem to ſpeak of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an act of Government, &amp; of officers as officers, yet we do not grant it, but rather prove our ſenſe of it, by denying it in that ſenſe which they plead for it in.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed we proceed to our Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. Whatſoever would neceſſarily and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably infer Ordination to be unattainable, that is contrary to ſound doctrine, and is not to be aſſerted. But that ſome believers may not lawfully or warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ordain without officers in a Church that hath no officers in it, that would neceſſarily and unavoidably infer Ordination to be unattainable. <hi>Ergo,</hi> That ſome believers may not lawfully or warrantably ordain without officers, in a Church that hath no officers in it, is contrary to ſound Doctrine, and is not to be aſſerted.</p>
               <p>The major none can deny who plead for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as an ordinance of Chriſt ſtill continuing; for if it be of Chriſts appointment doubtleſs he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a way wherein it is attainable.</p>
               <p>The Minor we prove thus;</p>
               <p>Becauſe there are no officers on earth authorized or appointed by Chriſt to ordain (in caſe a Church hath
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:120096:174"/>
no officers in it) any more then believers without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and therefore if believers without officers may not ordain, then no more may any officers (for one is as much warranted as the other) and ſo Ordination is unattainable.</p>
               <p>That no officers on earth are authorized or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to ordain in ſuch a caſe, any more then believers without officers we prove, becauſe ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers muſt be authorized or appointed by Chriſt to ordain either by general Goſpel rules which ſpeak nothing of Ordination it ſelf, but onely of ſuch acts as it conſiſteth of, and who may perform theſe, and thoſe general rules will warrant believers and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize them to ordain as much as officers, for believers may uſe Prayer upon ſpecial occaſions without officers, and are as well allowed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves thereunto as any officers. Or elſe ſuch officers muſt be warranted to ordain in ſuch caſes by the ſpecial Rules and examples which are left in the Goſpel about Ordination, and theſe do not limit Ordination to officers (in caſe a Church hath no officers in it) nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to ordain any more then believers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out officers; For, either they were extraordinary officers to whom the Rules were given about Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and who acted therein, and ſo thoſe Churches where they ordained, were not without officers, for they were officers in all Churches where they came. Or elſe they had an extraordinary call to ordain, and ſo they will not warrant any ordinary officers without an extraordinary call to ordain, any more then believers without officers.</p>
               <p>There is not one precept for, nor Preſident or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of any ordinary officers acting in Ordination (out of the particular Church he is over) upon any ordinary call in any one Text: that Ordination is ſpoken
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:120096:175"/>
of, as will be evident by examining the ſeveral places that ſpeak about it.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 2, 3, 5, 6. Either the twelve Apoſtles alone (who were extraordinary Officers) were the perſons ordaining; or the Apoſtles and the Diſciples together, <hi>v. 3. whom we may appoint; [we] i. e.</hi> as ſome think you and we, as <hi>[we]</hi> doth often include the perſons ſpoken to, as well as the perſon ſpeaking, as <hi>Eph. 2. 5. When [we]</hi> i. e. you and <hi>we were dead in ſins,</hi> v. 10. <hi>[we]</hi> i. e. you and <hi>we</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>are his workmanſhip,</hi> &amp;c. and then it belongeth to the people to ordain: however the Apoſtles were Officers in that Church.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Act.</hi> 13. v. 1, 2, 3. The perſons ordaining were Prophets and Teachers: if it be meant of ordinary Prophets, ſuch as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. then it proveth that ſuch as are no Officers may act with Officers in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if they were extraordinary Prophets, ſo might the Teachers be alſo, for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (who were extraordinary Officers) are reckoned up as ſome of the Prophets or Teachers that were in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> v. 1. and ſeeing it cannot be proved that any of them were ordinary Teachers, and if they were, yet they were in the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> v. 1. hence this place doth not evidence that it belongeth to ordinary Officers to ordain in a Church that hath no Officers of its own. And our brethren themſelves tell us, <hi>that this was by the immediate appointment of the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Ghoſt ſaid,</hi> ſeparate me, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> v. 4. and they add further, <hi>this was an extraordinary thing, and therefore not ſufficient to ground an ordinary practice upon.</hi> So that from their own words we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the call was extraordinary, and therefore it will not warrant ſuch perſons to ordain, who have no ſuch extraordinary call thereunto.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. Our brethren ſay, the perſons that did ordain were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:120096:175"/>
               <p>As for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. The perſon ſpoken to was <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> who was an extraordinary officer, an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
               <p>As for 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 6. Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle. As for <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. he was an Evangeliſt alſo, (as our brethren grant) becauſe he was ſent from place to place, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 6. 16, 23. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10. and was to ordain as <hi>Paul</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. As for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. we ſee nothing from the word to convince us that any one in that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, was an ordinary officer, and though it be uſually taken for granted that it was an ordinary Presbytery, yet we much queſtion it, and whereas it is often urged to ſhew a neceſſity of an ordinarie Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in theſe dayes for the mannaging of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affairs, and ſome are ready to ſay that an ordinance of Chriſt is wanting in many Churches becauſe there is but one Presbyter, no Presbytery; to all ſuch plea's we ſay, it is a mercy the Lord hath afforded a Presbytery or diverſe Presbyters to ſome Churches; but ſuppoſe a Church, as <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> had fix or eight Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, theſe it will eaſily be granted did make a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Presbytery to act in Church-affairs, but if the Lord added ſix or eight Presbyters more to the former number, it was a mercy, yet no ordinance of Chriſt was wanting when they were but ſix or eight in all; nor no new power was given by ſuch an addition as made the number twelve or ſixteen, but onely more perſons were afforded for aſſiſtance in the uſe of that power which before fewer had. So if there be put one elder in a Church, the Presbyterial power reſideth in him, and ſo no ordinance of Chriſt is wanting then, and if the Lord addeth more Presbyters that there be a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in a Church, no new power is given by ſuch an addition, for if theſe act in a united way as a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, they are but Presbyterial acts which are put forth, and ſo they are if a ſingle Presbyter putteth forth the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:120096:176"/>
ſame acts, and therefore here is the onely difference that we can find; where there is a Presbytery, more perſons uſe that power which one alone may uſe; And as one that laid hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> (and ſo joyned with other Presbyters in the very ſame act that this Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is ſaid to perform,) was an extraordinary officer, <hi>viz. Paul, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim.</hi> 1. 6. So might all the reſt in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery be, as well as one. It might conſiſt onely of extraordinary officers and yet aptly be called a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, for they were Presbyters. If the Apoſtles one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. yet they might be called a Presbytery or elſe that will evidence that it doth not belong to a Presbytery onely to ordain: and why may not that be called a Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. though it conſiſted onely of extraordinary officers, as well as that company, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. And the word Presbytery being no where elſe found but in this place in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where it can be ſuppoſed to intend any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Aſſembly of Chriſts appointment, and fairly admitting of ſuch an interpretation in this place, hence our brethren are wholly at a loſſe for a Rule for their Presbyteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>However our brethren ſay, that thoſe words by prophecie, do ſignifie the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 167.</note> moving cauſe and that which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged <hi>Paul</hi> with the Presbytery to lay hands on <hi>Timothy;</hi> and if ſo, then whether the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were ordinary or not, the call to lay on hands (being by propheſie) was extraordinary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore not ſufficient to ground an ordinary practice upon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it may be ſeen that none of the ſpecial rules laid down in Scripture about Ordination do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther limit and reſtrain it unto ordinary officers (when a Church wanteth officers) or warrant them to be the perſons that ought then to ordain, any
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:120096:176"/>
more then believers who are no officers. Indeed, although thoſe ſpecial rules do prove that Ordination is an ordinance of Chriſt ſtill continuing, &amp; therefore that ſome perſons are to ordain, yet we cannot find that they hold out at all who ought to be the perſons ordaining, for in theſe dayes there are no ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary officers, none that have ſuch an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry call to ordain, as theſe had, and therefore unleſſe we look to general rules (which will warrant believers doing it as well as officers) there are none on earth that can claim a power to ordain, and ſo Ordination will be altogether unattainable.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But they might act as ordinary officers although they were extraordinary officers, all their acts did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the extraordinarineſſe of their call, and ſo their acting may warrant ordinary officers in Ordaining.</hi>

That the act of Ordination was ordinary we grant, but that the perſons, in ordaining acted as ordinary officers onely, this we deny: their acting about Ordination was in part extraordinary as the immediateneſs of the call and the nature of the directions, do evidence, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. ver. 5. Do the work of an Evangeliſt, Tit. 1. 5. and ordain elders in every City as I have appointed thee.</hi> In obeying ſuch exhortations they cannot be deemed to act as ordinary officers, for to do the work of an Evangeliſt, and to ordain in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry city, and by the appointment of an Apoſtle, is that which belongeth not to ordinary officers: they are not Evangeliſts, and are fixed in their particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and therefore cannot be required to do the work of ſuch an office as they have not, or to travel from place to place as <hi>Titus</hi> was; which maketh it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there was ſomething extraordinary in their acting in Ordination.</p>
               <p>2. If they acted as ordinary officers, yet that will not warrant officers ordaining, in caſe a
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:120096:177"/>
Church hath no Officers, as will appear by our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. In a Church which hath no Officer or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in it, either ſome believers may lawfully and warrantably ordain without Officers, or elſe ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Officers of other Churches or elſe Officers of other Churches onely, without other believers, muſt be the perſons appointed by Chriſt to ordain, or elſe in ſuch a caſe, there is no way laid out by Chriſt for the attaining of Ordination.</p>
               <p>The laſt we ſuppoſe none that plead for Ordination will aſſert, nor any that argue againſt believers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, for, if Chriſt hath laid out no way in ſuch a caſe to attain Ordination, then either ſuch Churches as are without Officers, muſt for ever be without them, or elſe ſome perſons muſt ordain, who are not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt to do it, and then ſurely believers may do it as well as any other.</p>
               <p>If ſome Officers of other Churches, and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be appointed by Chriſt to ordain, then it doth not belong onely to a Presbytery to ordain; for, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers who are no Officers (according to this grant) may act in it; then it belongeth to believers, and is not peculiar to Church Officers to ordain; and then why are the people cryed out againſt ſo much for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining? or why may not Officers be blamed as well for ordaining without the people, as the people for ordaining without Officers? But we ſuppoſe they will aſſert the other, <hi>viz. That Officers of other Churches one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without believers, muſt be the perſons appointed by Chriſt to ordain,</hi> and let them prove it.</p>
               <p>When we ſay <hi>[without believers]</hi> we mean without their concurrence in a way of acting, for our brethren will grant their concurrence by way of preſence; they will give liberty to believers to be preſent when they ordain, but not to act in Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:120096:177"/>
Our Brethren who ſay, <hi>Ordination by people without Miniſters, is a perverting of the Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c. let them prove, that it belongeth to Officers of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to ordain, or that Chriſt hath appointed Officers to ordain who are without that Church, to which a perſon is ordained an Officer, or elſe their Ordination by a Presbytery of Officers of other Churches, is as much a perverting of the Ordinance, and of no more force (to uſe their own words) then baptiſm by a Midwife, &amp;c. for what can hinder the peoples Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from being lawful, and of validity, but their wanting a Commiſſion from Chriſt, or a Goſpel Rule to warrant their acting in Ordination? And the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of other Churches are as much without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt, or a Goſpel rule to warrant their becoming a Presbytery, and acting as a Presbytery in ordaining Officers to Churches that have no Officers, as the people can be.</p>
               <p>We have under the former Argument found, that all the Texts which ſpeak about Ordination, they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate either the officers that acted in it, or the call to be extraordinary. Neither is there any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that doth certainly prove any ordinary Officers acting in Ordination in all the New Teſtament, much leſs is there any colour for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one precept or preſident, to warrant a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of officers of divers Churches to be of Chriſts Inſtitution, or to have any allowance from him to act in Ordination. We cannot but wonder that ſome ſhould go about to aſſert, that acts ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Presbytery, without giving proof that ſuch a Presbytery conſiſting of the Officers of divers Churches is of a Goſpel ſtamp. Surely it ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be an Ordinance of Chriſt, before it be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what it ought to do.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Act. 6. Act. 13. Act. 14. Tit. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 5.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:120096:178"/>
either they acted as Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, whoſe Commiſſion reached to all Churches, or as Officers in thoſe Churches where they ordained men, and their general Commiſſion made them Officers in and to all Churches where they became, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Churches they acted in, they acted not barely as Officers, as Miniſters, but as their Officers, as their Miniſters, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he had the care of all the Churches, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 28. and therefore theſe examples will not warrant Officers of divers Churches to ordain Officers unto Churches that have no officers.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts ordained in Churches they were officers to, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may ordain in Churches which they are no officers to, ſurely the inconſequence will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>As for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. It is probable it was a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of extraordinary officers, however that it was a Presbytery which conſiſted of ordinary officers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers congregations, there is not a ſyllable in the Text that way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scriptures hold forth neither precept nor preſident for the neceſſary ſubordination of any Church of Chriſt, to any ſociety of men without it ſelf, for any acts of Church-government, as this is by our brethren ſuppoſed to be; it is ordinary for Churches to be without any officers, either by the death or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, &amp;c. of thoſe that were ſeated in them, and if they cannot attain officers without ſome officers of other Churches put forth acts of Government and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to make officers for them, that will imply a neceſſary ſubordination of Churches to other ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without them, which is no where warranted by the Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no Goſpel Rule to warrant any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers in putting forth any acts of Government,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:120096:178"/>
or any Presbyterial acts properly ſo called, towards any perſons without thoſe particular congregations where they are fixed as officers: let our brethren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ſuch Goſpel rule to juſtifie their acting (both for matter and manner) as Presbyters, as officers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any beyond their particular Churches, over which they are made overſeers.</p>
               <p>They are officers whereever they act, but they do not act as Presbyters to any out of their particular congregation. If 40. or 100. Mayors, Bayliffs or Conſtables meet together, they may be called Mayors, Bayliffs, or Conſtables, but cannot act unitedly in any acts of ſuch offices; though they be officers, and have a lawful authority to act ſingly, every one within his own precincts, yet they have no power to act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as ſuch officers; all the Mayors have not power to act together as Mayors to any one Corporation, all thoſe Conſtables have not power to act together as Conſtables; ſo Miniſters have a power from Chriſt to act as officers, as Presbyters in their own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but if a hundred of them meet, they have not power to act together as Presbyters, as Officers, to any one congregation. It is not not enough that they are all Officers of Chriſt to warrant their acting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as Officers, but they muſt be commiſſionated by Chriſt to act in combination, and together, as a Presbytery, or elſe they cannot juſtifie their actings.</p>
               <p>There is no Scripture warrant for any other Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but that onely which is within a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and there is no rule to juſtifie a Presbytery of a particular congregation, in putting forth any acts as a Presbytery, towards any but the members of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation where they are fixed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome believers may as lawfully ordain, as any Presbyters in the world, for their power as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, extendeth no further then their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:120096:179"/>
Congregations, and if they do not act as Elders in ordaining, then why may not believers ordain without Officers? Divers of Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> Arguments againſt hearing of men not ordained, we may uſe here, and they will conclude much more ſtrongly againſt calling in Officers of ſeveral Churches, and their acting in combination, or together as a Presbytery in ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers for a Church which is without Officers. Such a company of Officers have no promiſe made to them in acting as a Presbytery, nor the people in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them in for that end, and therefore they cannot pray in faith for a bleſſing upon them therein, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his third Argument. Ordaining Officers is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted worſhip, and Officers of divers Churches are are not warranted either by Scripture precept or preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to become a Presbytery, and as a Presbytery to ordain, and therefore by his fourth Argument, it is ſinful.</p>
               <p>It is to run out of Gods bleſſing, for there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by God to it, and it is a running upon temptation, becauſe a Presbytery of Officers of divers Churches, is no ordinary means of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore to practice that way, is ſinful and unlawful, by his ſixth Argument. It is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of other mens ſins, for ſuch a Presbytery is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in ordaining, and ſo in ſinning (they having no warrant as a Presbytery to ordain) by mens coming to be ordained, and therefore it is ſinful by his ſeventh Argument. And thus it may be ſeen what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies the aſſerting Ordination to be an act of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery as ſuch, draweth along with it. But if Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be no act of Government, no act peculiar to a Presbytery as ſuch, (which as we conceive it is not) then a Presbytery may ordain where a Church hath one, and either ſome believers without Officers may ordain, or the Officers of other Churches may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:120096:179"/>
in to ordain, (not as a Presbytery, but as perſons meet and able to do ſuch acts as Ordination conſiſteth of) in caſe a Church hath no Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If ſome believers who are no Officers may publickly preach, then in a Church that hath no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, they may lawfully or warranably ordain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out officers. For there is no Scripture-light to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ordination is ſo great a work as preaching, or that it is more limited or reſtrained to officers then preaching is. But ſome believers (i. e. ſuch as are gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) who are no officers may publickly preach, as we have largely proved. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſome believers, in a Church that hath no officers, may lawfully and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably ordain, without officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If ſome believers may (with Chriſts allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) act in other ſpecial, publick, Church-works, then alſo in a Church that hath no officers, they may ordain, unleſs ſome ſpecial reaſon can be given againſt their ordaining, more then againſt their doing thoſe works; for the Scripture doth not limit and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize all the ſervices they may act in. But ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may (with Chriſts allowance) act in other ſpecial, publick, Church-works, and there can be no ſpecial reaſon given againſt their ordaining, more then againſt their doing thoſe other works. <hi>Ergo,</hi> in a Church that hath no officers they may ordain.</p>
               <p>The Minor we prove from <hi>Act. 15. 2. They determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and certain other of them, ſhould go up to Jeruſalem, unto the Apoſtles and Elders about this queſtion.</hi> A Church then hath power to chuſe, call, and depute, not onely officers, but others of their members to act in ſpecial, publick ſervices, as occaſion is offered, and neceſſity requireth; and this deputation was to act in a publick Aſſembly, as the chapter ſheweth; and will our brethren ſay, that thoſe may act in a Synod, who may not act in ordination?
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:120096:180"/>
Nay, the brethren acted in that Synod, v. 22. <hi>Then it pleaſed the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to Antioch, &amp;c.</hi> by which it is evident, that a Church of Chriſt hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by an occaſional choice to authorize ſome believers to act in ſpecial, publick buſineſſes, appertaining to the Church; yea, the brethren acted in making the very decree it ſelf, <hi>v. 23. The Apoſtles, and Elders, and Brethren ſend greeting,</hi> &amp;c. The decree runneth in the Brethrens name, as well as in the Officers name, as the Title ſheweth; and therefore, either our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt ſay, that ſome believers may ordain, or elſe that men may act in making decrees in a Synod, who may not ordain, then they will make a Synod inferiour to a claſſical Presbytery. Neither is it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, that Officers acted in this Synod as well as Brethren, for Apoſtles acted in it alſo, and we may aſſert, that the Brethren of Churches may act in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical way, without Elders, when they want Elders, as well as our brethren may ſay, that Elders in theſe dayes may act in a Synodical way, without Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p>Our Argument therefore may run thus.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that may act (as our brethren phraſe it) in making decrees in a Synod, they may ordain. But ſome believers (who are no Officers) may act in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king decrees in a Synod. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſome believers (who are no Officers) may ordain.</p>
               <p>That a Church may deſign fit perſons to perform ſome ſpecial ſervices, we might evidence, alſo from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. v. 18, 19. <hi>Who was alſo choſen of the Churches,</hi> v. 23. <hi>They are the Meſſengers of the Churches,</hi> &amp;c. Let any ſhew any ſpecial reaſon, why the Churches may not chuſe and depute fit perſons to ordain, as well as to perform other ſpecial and publick ſervices, when occaſion is offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:120096:180"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Thoſe that give the eſſence of the call to office, may alſo give the adjunct. But ſome believers without Officers, do give the eſſence of the call to Office; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſome believers may give the Adjunct.</p>
               <p>The Major our brethren grant, theſe are their own words; <q>If Election give the eſſence to a Miniſter, and Ordination onely <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> p. 188.</note> an Adjunct, we ſee no reaſon why they that give the eſſence, ſhould not alſo give the Adjunct. It is in the Lords power to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an Adjunct, more then that which is eſſential; but let any prove that in this caſe any ſuch limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is given; if not, then they that may do the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter act, may do the leſſer, when it is about the ſame matter, and for the ſame general end; otherwiſe the diſability to do the leſſer, might render the greater act in a great meaſure fruſtraneous as to its end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Minor we have proved before, in ſhowing that Election is that which giveth the eſſence to the outward call to office, and that Election belongeth to a Church: and if Election giveth the eſſence, then Ordination muſt needs be but an Adjunct to that call.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>As to what is objected, that if this Argument be valid, it would follow, that people might ordain their own Miniſters, not onely when they want Elders, but when they have Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This doth not deny the Argument, but ſtrengthen it; if our brethren will grant that, it is more then we ask of them; if the Argument will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more then we produce it for, that doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the validity of it, unleſs it can be proved that it croſſeth ſome Goſpel Rule therein.</p>
               <p>2. We deny that ſuch a conſequence is neceſſary; for, ſuch a duty is to be performed by the meeteſt and ableſt perſons in a Church, becauſe that tendeth moſt to edification, and it is ſuppoſed, that where a Church
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:120096:181"/>
hath Officers, they are meeteſt and ableſt to go before the Church in prayer, and therefore they cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, though we know not, but if that they want help, they may be aſſiſted by the ableſt members. Alſo, where a Church hath officers, they are choſen purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take the charge of the weighty concernments of the Church, and to be chiefly active therein for the good of the Church, and therefore by their place, they are obliged to go before it in all its affairs, which are not by ſome ſpecial word of inſtitution limited unto others.</p>
               <p>And even in family-relation, a woman being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a husband, or in his abſence, may go before the houſhold in prayer and other family duties, which having a husband, it belongeth to his place to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, when ſhe hath his preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If Ordination conſiſteth in, or be made up of ſuch acts onely, as believers may undoubtedly perform, and theſe acts be not limited in their uſe upon this occaſion, to officers onely, then in a Church which hath no Officers, ſome believers may lawfully or warrantably ordain, without Officers. But Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conſiſteth in, or is made up of ſuch acts onely, as believers may undoubtedly perform, and theſe acts are not limited in their uſe upon this occaſion to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers onely. <hi>Ergo,</hi> In a Church which hath no Officers, ſome believers may lawfully or warrantably ordain, without Officers.</p>
               <p>The Major is undeniable, if believers may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the acts that are uſed about Ordination upon other occaſions, none can with any ſhadow of reaſon confine thoſe acts here onely to Officers, unleſs they be limited to them on this occaſion, as they are not upon other occaſions.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the Minor we ſhall prove, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering all the requiſites unto Ordination. There are
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:120096:181"/>
but three things on the part of the perſon ordaining that can be proved to have been belonging to it. 1. Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. Prayer. 3. Impoſition of hands. And we ſuppoſe the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, is that which it doth conſiſt in, and is made up of, ſo far as any man doth act in it, yet we ſhall ſpeak to all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome believers may faſt upon ſolemn oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, cannot be denyed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. Nay that they may faſt upon this very occaſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining officers, will (we ſuppoſe) readily be granted, and may probably be gathered from, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then belongeth to believers and not to officers onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That prayer is a duty which believers may yea ought dayly to perform, is undenyable alſo; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 13. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. And that they may and ought to pray for officers is evident alſo, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Brethren pray for us.</hi> The Apoſtles called upon the believing <hi>Theſſ alonians</hi> to pray for them, pray [for us;] 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3 <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Finally brethren pray for us, &amp;c.</hi> This Epiſtle is directed to the Church, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. 1. and here the brethren are called upon to pray for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, yea for extraordinary officers, pray [for us;] and what ſhould be the end of their Praying? or what ſhould they pray for? [that the word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified. Surely this is the main the chief thing prayed for, in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Preaching officers, that the Lord would make them very proſperous in the work they are called to, that the word diſpenſed by them may have free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Let any prove any greater end of prayer in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation then this is. And if believers may pray for the ſame end that men do in ordaining officers, what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial difference is there between this and acting in Ordination? indeed this is a dayly work, and that a ſolemn ſet day for the ſame work; that uſhereth them
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:120096:182"/>
into the work of their office; this is conſtantly to be performed whileſt they are in their work; but why believers may not act in prayer for their officers upon a ſolomn ſet day, as well as they may every day pray for them, for the very ſame ends that ſuch a ſet day is intended for, we find not.</p>
               <p>And by this we ſee cauſe to think that the Apoſtles had no ſuch low eſteem or account of the prayers of the people, as ſome have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Pray for us;</hi> hence one well obſerveth that the greateſt Apoſtle hath need of the prayers of the meaneſt Chriſtian, and may be helped thereby, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore was kept in priſon, but prayer was made without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Church, unto God for him, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. many were gathered together praying. Not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers onely, but the Church prayed; and not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively, but collectively, many prayed together; here is publike prayer by the Church for an officer under perſecution, and why may not believers as well pray together for an officer at his Admiſſion into his work? By this it appeareth that the people may perform the ſubſtantial act of Ordination. <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, and that for the very ſame end that it ſerveth to in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That impoſition of hands (if ſtill continuing) may be uſed by believers; we might wave this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo queſtionable whether by the will of Chriſt it be ſtill to continue or not? but if it be of uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ordination, then believers may lay on hands alſo. This appeareth</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe impoſition of hands at the utmoſt can be but an Adjunct to Ordination; our brethren in their Arguments for it, yet do not aſſert it to be any more then an Adjunct, neither is there any Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it was any more, in the Primitive times.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:120096:182"/>
And therefore, the people may lay on hands, for our brethren tell us, that they ſee no reaſon, why they that give the Eſſence, ſhould not alſo give the Adjunct. The people (as we have proved) may give the Eſſence of Ordination, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> They may give the Adjunct, <hi>viz.</hi> Impoſition of hands.</p>

               <p>This Argument will be of the more weight becauſe, as our brethren aſſert, impoſition of hands is not a proper Goſpel duty, never uſed but in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is a Rite and ceremony borrowed from the old Teſtament, &amp;c. from hence we infer, that we have more reaſon in this then in other matters to look to the old Teſtament for a warrant about the uſe of it, eſpecially in a caſe where the new Teſtament doth not clearly direct us, (as muſt needs be the caſe when a Church wanteth officers) becauſe it was borrowed from the old Teſtament; neither can a National Church or other old Teſtament orders be inferred from our uſing this Argument, becauſe it cannot be proved that National Churches, &amp;c. are by Chriſt made Goſpel inſtitutions, as impoſition of hands is, if it be continuing.

ſaith, And as Maſter <hi>Mather</hi> alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth this term is uſed in the ninth verſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preceding; and in the eleventh verſe immediately following, and fifteen or ſixteen ſeveral times in this Chapter, <hi>Num</hi> 8. and yet of all theſe not ſo much as one, where it can be underſtood of the elders and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as ſuch, but is uſed to ſignifie all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as he rightly thinketh. The people might lay hands on officers in old Teſtament dayes, from whence the Rite is borrowed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The people may lay hands on officers in new Teſtament dayes (if the Rite be ſtill of uſe) in caſe a Church hath no officers in it.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren object ſeveral things againſt this, which we ſhall briefly anſwer.</p>
               <p>Objeb. 1. <hi>Here</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons were preſent, and if it proves any thing, it proves that the people may Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, where there are elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it will prove that the people may impoſe hands when elders are preſent, then much more when they are wanting. This is not againſt our aſſertion, but more for it, and much againſt our brethrens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>The children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were commanded by God immediately to lay on hands upon the</hi> Levites. <hi>But in the new Teſtament we meet with no ſuch command laid upon the people. We read that</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>and the Presbytery are to lay on bands, but not a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The command was immediate to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not immediate to the children of <hi>Iſrael, Num. 8. ver. 5, 6. And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes ſaying, take the Levites, &amp;c. verſ. 10. And thou ſhalt bring the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites before the Lord, and the children of Iſrael ſhall put their hands upon the Levites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The command was mediate to the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:120096:183"/>
i. e.</hi> by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus whoſoever the perſons be, whether officers or the people, that in new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dayes are to ordain and lay on hands, they are commanded by God to do it, as immediately as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were here to lay on hands upon the <hi>Levites,</hi> for the Lord gave forth thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands immediately to the Apoſtles as he did this to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore this objection will as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that officers may ordain or impoſe hands on of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as that the people may do it.</p>
               <p>2. If the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been commanded by God immediately to lay on hands upon the Levites, yet ſeeing this was the firſt inſtitution of the Levites office, it would not deny it to be a pattern: For, the inſtitution of a new office muſt be given forth by the Lord immedediately to ſome perſons or other.</p>
               <p>3. If impoſition of hands was uſed in old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment days by the people, and in new Teſtament dayes, there can be ſhewn no repeal of that Rule by which they did it, then they may ſtill uſe it. Let any ſhew a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal in the new Teſtament, if they can. We read that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> and the Presbytery laid on hands, but at the utmoſt that can onely prove an enlargement of the power, or that more perſons may do it, it doth not prove that the perſons who formerly did it, now may not do it. It can onely ſhew that ſome officers may lay on hands, it doth not ſhew, that the people (who formerly might) now may not lay on hands.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>When it is ſaid that the children of Iſrael laid on hands, it is not imaginable that all the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>did put on hands, but it was done by ſome chief of them in the name of reſt, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is ſufficient to our purpoſe, for ſo ſome of the chief men, in a Church; ſome of the moſt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:120096:184"/>
eminent believers may lay hands on. Officers in the name of the reſt; we do not ſay that every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in a Church muſt lay on hands.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>The Levites were taken by God in ſtead of the firſt-born, as appears, Numb. 8. 16, 17. and hence it was that the children of Iſrael, that is, the firſt born of Iſrael, were to lay on hands upon them, for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites gave an atonement for them, and were offered up to the Lord in their ſtead, and as the Rabbins ſay, every firſt born laid on hands on the Levite that was for him; which if it be ſo, will afford us two other anſwers to this Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The children of Iſrael had not onely a ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but a ſpecial reaſon alſo for what they did. And wherefore this example cannot be made a pattern for New Testament practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this laying on of hands upon the Levites, was not for them to ſet them apart for the ſervice of the Lord, but rather a ſetting them apart for a ſacrifice unto the Lord. It was the command of God that the children of Iſrael muſt put their hands upon the ſacrifices they did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the firſt-born onely, did lay hands on the Levites, is not proved. It is true, they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inſtead of the firſt-born, but it was the Lords command that warranted the perſons to lay hands on the Levites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 10. and that runs in general to the children of Iſrael, and therefore did not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the firſt-born, more then any other perſons to do it. Hence,</p>
               <p>2. If the firſt-born did lay hands on the Levites, it was not by vertue of any office, but in the name, and by the appointment of the children of Iſrael, for the command did run to them in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:120096:184"/>
3. If the children of Iſrael had laid their hands upon the Levites, upon the account of that command of God, which required their putting hands upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices they did offer, then every man of them muſt have laid hands on them, for ſo that command injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. v. 2. <hi>When any man of you ſhall offer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>V. 4. [He] <hi>ſhall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering,</hi> &amp;c. Not a ſubſtitute, not another for him, but <hi>[he]</hi> every one to whom the offering belonged, ought to impoſe hands upon it himſelf: and this would overthrow their third objection, which ſaith, <hi>It is not imaginable that all the Iſraelites did put on hands,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo this denyeth that it was onely the firſt-born that did impoſe hands, and ſo deſtroyeth a great part of this fourth obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>4. It is not proved that this laying on of hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Levites was a ſetting them apart for a ſacrifice unto the Lord, and therefore the objection is altogether groundleſs: we do not read that hands were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on all ſacrifices or offerings, no not on the firſt-born, in whoſe ſtead the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vites were taken; neither do we remember that the people were to impoſe hands on any but the burnt-offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. v. 4. <hi>He ſhall put his hand upon the head of [the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering] and it ſhall be accepted for him, to make atonement for him;</hi> other Sacrifices <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, or the Elders, &amp;c. impoſed hands on, when that ceremony was uſed about them at all. And that the Levites were not ſuch a ſacrifice, the very name <hi>[burnt offering]</hi> will truly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Nay, it is plain, that the end of their offering before the Lord was, that they might execute
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:120096:185"/>
their office, <hi>Numb. 8. v. 11. And Aaron ſhall offer the Levites before the Lord, for an offering</hi> (not of the firſt-born onely, as our brethren would have it, but) <hi>of the children of Iſrael,</hi> (not as their propitiation and atonement, or as a ſacrifice, but) <hi>that they may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſervice of the Lord;</hi> ſo v. 15, 16. They were indeed to make atonement for the children of Iſrael, but not by offering ſacrifices for the peoples ſins (for that was done by the Prieſts onely), nor by being a ſacrifice to make atonement for them, (becauſe no ſuch end of <hi>Aarons</hi> offering them up is proved, and another end is mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, 21.) but by their other ſervice in the Text, and this the words following do confirm, <hi>[That there be no plague among the children of Iſrael, when the children of Iſrael come nigh unto the Sanctuary].</hi> Their making atonement was after they were offered, not by being offered for an offering unto the Lord; And by many verſes it is plain, that their ſetting apart was for the ſervice of the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 15, 19, 21, 22. and therefore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection vaniſheth.</p>
               <p>Our brethren obſerve, That notwithſtanding this impoſition of hands, the Levites were not thereupon inveſted into their office, it was <hi>Aarons</hi> waving of the Levites, and ſeparating them from among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, that did conſtitute and make them Church-officers.</p>
               <p>If this be fully granted, nothing is gained againſt us, for we are far from thinking that Ordination doth conſtitute or make Church officers, much leſs do we imagine that impoſition of hands doth it. But from hence we gather thus much, That it was not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of impoſition of hands, in Old Teſtament dayes to confer an office; and therefore ſeeing the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was borrowed thence, it is very unlikely that
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:120096:185"/>
in New Teſtament dayes it ſhould be intended for ſuch an end.</p>
               <p>And thus we have proved the firſt part of the Minor of our ſixth Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That believers may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly perform all the acts which Ordination (ſo far as any man acteth in it) doth confiſt in, or is made up of.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe acts are not limited in their uſe upon the occaſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, to Officers onely; we prove thus, becauſe none of the Texts which ſpeak of Ordination do li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Officers onely, let our brethren prove any ſuch limitation, and unleſſe they can do that (which we ſuppoſe they never can) it will neceſſarily follow, That in a Church which hath no Officers, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may lawfully or warrantably ordain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Officers. If they may perform the ſame acts upon other occaſions, and they be not limited and confined to Officers upon this occaſion, then they may perform them here alſo. And for the clearing of this, that there is no ſuch limitation, we ſhall examine briefly our brethrens Arguments againſt Ordination by the people, without Miniſters.</p>
               <p>They tell us, <q>That they might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from what is recorded by Jewiſh <note place="margin">

And ſo for thoſe ſeventy Elders, it is certain from the Jewiſh Writers, that the ſucceſſion of theſe was continued through all ages, by their creating others in the place of thoſe that died, by this ceremony of impoſition of hands, &amp;c.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:120096:186"/>
To all which we anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe things (except that of <hi>Moſes)</hi> are not recorded in Scripture (as themſelves confeſs) and therefore are no cogent Arguments to evince the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch a ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The uſe and end of Impoſition of hands by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> on <hi>Joſhua,</hi> was, the conferring of gifts, <hi>Deut. 34. 9. And</hi> Joſhua <hi>the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. We may far better argue for the peoples impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hands on Officers, from their laying hands on the Levites, then they can for Officers doing it, from Jewiſh Writers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If ſuch a line of ſucceſſion be neceſſary, how can any in theſe dayes prove their own ſtanding to be legitimate, for we are perſwaded they cannot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that this line of ſucceſſion hath holden all along from the Apoſtles dayes, until themſelves were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; and if it were ever broken, they are as ill as ordained by the people, for then ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained perſons did ordain thoſe that derived Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to them. But they wave this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would fetch four Arguments from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt the peoples ordaining, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is not one example amongſt all theſe alleadged, which proveth that ordinary Officers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ordinary Officers; If Apoſtles ordained, <hi>Act. 6. Act.</hi> 14. and Evangeliſts, <hi>Tit. 1. 1 Tim</hi> 5. 22 theſe were extraordinary Officers; and ſo were ſome of thoſe Teachers, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1. as <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſo might all the reſt be; however the perſons ordained, and the call to ordain, was extraordinary, <hi>v</hi> 2 the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not proved to conſiſt of ordinary Officers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and however it was an Evangeliſt that hands were impoſed upon, and the call to it extraordinary (as we have ſhewed); ſo that our breathren cannot find an example of ordinary Officers ordaining ordinary O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ficers, amongſt any of theſe inſtances; and therefore they are at as great a loſs for an example of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as the people are for an example of theirs in ordaining.</p>
               <p>2. None of theſe examples do ſpeak of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Church that is without Officers: we may grant that where a Church hath Officers, they may ordain, but the queſtion is, whether the people may not ordain without Officers, in a Church that hath no Officers in it? Not one of the Texts alleadged do give us an example of Ordination in a Church that had no Officers, no Presbytery in it. The Apoſtles were Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in all Churches where they acted in Ordination, and ſo Evangeliſts, and ſo the perſons ordained by them, received Ordination from ſuch as were Officers in the ſame Churches where they were ordained; and it cannot be proved that the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. conſiſted of ordinary Officers of divers Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:120096:187"/>
We may turn our brethrens own words upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; We challange any man to ſhew any one Text in all the New Teſtament, for the juſtification of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by a Presbytery conſiſting of ordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of any other Churches; beſides that, where the perſon ordained is an Officer. And may we not ſay to ſuch a Presbytery that uſurpeth upon this work, as it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>By what authority do you theſe things? and who gave you this authority?</hi> ſo that ſtill our brethren are at as great a loſs to warrant their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice out of the Word, as the people can be.</p>
               <p>3. We have given divers Scriptural Arguments to prove, that in ſuch a caſe the people may ordain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Officers, and ſo we have anſwered the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</p>
               <p>4. None of theſe Texts do limit Ordination to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers onely, and therefore they ſpeak not againſt the peoples ordaining, without Officers: If ten or twenty examples could be given of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, yea, and ordinary Officers ordaining, yet theſe could but conclude Affirmatively, that officers may ordain, they would not conclude Negatively, that none but Officers muſt ordain: as, there are many examples in the New Teſtament, which ſhew, that profeſſing belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and repenters were baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12, 37, 38. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3. but they are far from concluding, that none elſe may, for then no Infants might be baptized: So here, becauſe Apoſtles, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Prophets, Teachers, and a Presbytery did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; to ſay, <hi>Ergo,</hi> none elſe may ordain, or therefore believers may not ordain without Officers, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is ſeeble.</p>
               <p>If Apoſtolical practice be of the nature of a Goſpel injunction to us in ordinary actings, yet it muſt be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively onely, that ſome perſons may in ſuch caſes
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:120096:187"/>
act in the ſame duties, but it doth not hold negatively, that no other perſon may in other caſes act therein. We may argue as ſtrongly from the Texts againſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers ordaining in a Church that hath no officers in it, as they can againſt believers ordaining without officers, it they will conclude negatively from them as thus, we read of Ordination by Apoſtles, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Teachers, by Evangeliſts, by a Presbytery, upon an extraordinary call, and in the Churches where they were officers; but for Ordination by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary officers we do not certainly read of that, and for Ordination by ordinary officers upon an ordinary call, or in Churches that had no offic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs in them, we meet not at all with it; and therefore as well may we conclude hence that ordinary officers may not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain in ſuch caſes, as they may that believers may not, without officers; for there is as little ſpoken of the one as of the other in thoſe Texts, and therefore they can gain nothing by this Argument.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Ordination by the people is not only not written in Scripture, but it is against the Scripture. For to what end and purpoſe ſhould Jeſus Chriſt appoint officers extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ordinary, for the doing of that work, which the people themſelves may do? to what purpoſe did</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>go from place to place to ordain elders? why was</hi> Titus <hi>left in</hi> Crete <hi>to appoint elders in every city? might not the people ſay, what need</hi> Paul <hi>leave</hi> Titus <hi>to do that which we can do our ſelves?</hi> Fruſtra fit per plura, &amp;c.</p>

In this time of the firſt plantation of Goſpel Churches, extraordinary helpes were neceſſary for the giving a knowledge of that Goſpel order which Chriſt would have obſerved in his Churches; and as Phyſical rules may be known in the Theoretical part, and yet it is needful to have direction in and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:120096:188"/>
about the practical part; ſo when the Apoſtles had converted people to the faith, it was needful that they or Evangeliſts, &amp;c. ſhould give them a knowledge of Church order, what Officers they ſhould have, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo direct them how to put in practice ſuch Goſpel Rules as are left about the attaining of Goſpel Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and although <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> had not acted at all in the Ordination, yet their going from place to place had not been unneceſſary, becauſe their guidance and direction was advantageous in coming up to Goſpel order.</p>
               <p>2. We might as well ſay, to what end and purpoſe ſhould the people ordain in thoſe dayes, when there were Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, who might (by their office) go from place to place, and ordain? many works that men lawfully may do, yet if others be put in truſt to do ſuch things, they ſay to what purpoſe ſhould we act in them, when they need no help, we will not take the works out of their hands; yet this hindreth not acting in them, when help is wanting, which is the caſe when a Church is without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>3. It is not proved, that the principal or chief end, of Chriſts appointing Officers, either extraordinary or ordinary, or of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in going from place to place, or of <hi>Titus</hi> in ſtaying at <hi>Crete,</hi> was to ordain Elders; that was but a little parcel of their work, whereas our brethren ſpeak of it as if it were the chief intendment of their journeyings too and fro. And unleſs it were their main buſineſs (which cannot be proved) what colour of reaſon is there in it againſt the peoples ordaining? becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> went about confirming the ſouls of Saints, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22, 23. and ordained Elders in ſome Churches in their journeyings, and becauſe <hi>Titus</hi> was
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:120096:188"/>
left at <hi>Crete</hi> to ſet in order things wanting, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and where they were without officers, did ordain elders, therefore it was to no end and purpoſe that they went from place to place, or that <hi>Titus</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Crete,</hi> if the people themſelves might ordain. Who will not diſcern the weakneſs of ſuch an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? it may eaſily be anſwered, that if they had not ordained one elder, or if the people had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained all in their preſence, yet there were other neceſſary ends and purpoſes that they were ſent from place to place about, <hi>viz.</hi> to Preach the Goſpel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt hath appointed officers to do ſome works, which others may do who are no officers, &amp; yet it was not in vain, or to no end and purpoſe that officers were appointed to do them: officers are appointed to viſit ſick, the <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the elders of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> and yet will any ſay, to what end and purpoſe are elders appointed to viſit the ſick, if others may be called for, and may viſit them? will our brethren ſay here, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, &amp;c.</hi> There might be ſome officers its like in ſome of thoſe Churches where they ordained elders, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Preached where they went, but will any ſay, to what purpoſe did they Preach, if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that were before in thoſe Churches did Preach? <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, &amp;c.</hi> This Argument would be as ſtrong againſt Apoſtles and Evangeliſts Preaching, where officers were who might Preach, as againſt the peoples ordaining without officers.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles and other officers might be appointed to do it, and yet the people might have liberty to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain in a Church without officers, and we can find no Scripure that this will be againſt.</p>

Object. 3. <q>All that is written in the <note place="margin">Jus Divin. Min pag. 186.</note> Epiſtles concerning the Ordainers, and the qualification of the ordained, &amp;c. is all written in the Epiſtles unto <hi>Timothy and Titus,</hi> who were Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. In the other Epiſtles which were written unto the Churches, there is no mention made of theſe things, which doth abundantly prove unto us, that the work of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a work belonging to Miniſters and not to the people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is uſual to direct charges unto officers, when yet the duties required are to be performed by the people, at leaſt when their concurrence with the offices is called for in coming up to the duties; ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. the Epiſtles are dedicated to the Angels of thoſe Churches, and yet our brethren grant that they are to be underſtood as meant of the whole Churches, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Revel. 1. 11. Revel. 2 ver.</hi> 7. 11, 17. So, although thoſe charges be directed to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> yet as Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> obſerveth, It never was intended they ſhould act them alone, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Either theſe things were to be acted by <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> with company, and then, why not by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as by officers? there is as little mention made of the concurrence of officers as of the people; and if we fetch the Rule for it from other Scriptures, then the qualifications of officers, being laid down in thoſe Epiſtles, as they were before the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their Election, <hi>Acts 6. ver.</hi> 3. hence we may ſafely conclude, that the people are intended, and are to be acters in following theſe charges as well as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were to act them alone, then they are written to them as Evangeliſts, or elſe it muſt be granted that it belongeth not to a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery only to ordain; one Presbyter may do it, and if to them as Evangeliſts, then they are no Preſidents unto us.</p>

2. All may aptly be written to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> although they acted not at all in the Ordinations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were to give directions unto others how to act in them. They might be directed to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were to ſee the things done, although many of them were to be done, not by themſelves, but by others hands, as <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. Surely <hi>Titus</hi> himſelf was not alone, nor with officers, to ſet in order all things that were wanting. If Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were wanting, was <hi>Titus</hi> and other officers onely to act herein? ſurely, the people were to chuſe them, according to <hi>Acts 6. ver.</hi> 3, 5. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the things written about, were not to be acted onely by Church-officers, but ſome of them by the people, with the guidance and direction of theſe officers which they had. So 1 <hi>Tim. 2. ver. 1, 2. I exhort, that first of all, ſupplications, prayers, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for Kings and for all that are in authority, &amp;c.</hi> will any ſay, that onely Church officers are to pray for Magiſtrates and thoſe in Authority? ſurely ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are no Church-officers may pray for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as well as for other men, and yet this charge is given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as well as that about Ordination, 1 <hi>Tim. 2 ver. 9. 11. In like manner alſo, that women adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel; let the women learn in ſilence with all ſubjection.</hi> This charge is given to <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo, as well as that about Ordination, and yet the things given in charge were to be acted by women, not by Church officers; but <hi>Timothy</hi> was to give forth directions unto women to put them in practice.</p>
               <p>By all which it is evident, that the writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (who were Church-officers) about Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, doth not prove that the work of Ordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:120096:190"/>
to Miniſters, and not to the people; for in the very ſame Epiſtles, the Apoſtle writeth to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> about other matters, which undoubtedly were to be acted by the people, and cannot be reſtrained to Church-officers. It is alſo conſiderable, that it is ſaid, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. v. 15. <hi>Grace be with you [all]:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more then <hi>Titus</hi> or Church-Officers, even all the Saints in thoſe places where <hi>Titus</hi> was, are written to. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. v. 15. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. v. 6. <hi>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of theſe things, thou ſhalt be a good Minister of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Whence we conclude that the deſign of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in directing theſe Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> who were Church-Officers, rather then to Churches, was not to reſtrain the acting of thoſe matters contained in the Epiſtles unto Church-Officers, but to excite <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to an exhorting and putting ſuch in remembrance to whom it belonged, to do them: and what is written about Ordination, may be acted by the people, as well as other matters in the Epiſtles, and the writing of them to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the one more then the other. If no other ſpecial reaſon can be produced out of the Epiſtles themſelves, we muſt have recourſe unto other Scriptures, to find out to whom it belongeth to ordain, and what is the uſe of theſe qualifications which are required to be in Officers, and we find that they are to regulate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Election as well as Ordination, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3, 5. Some things are written to them as Evangeliſts, others to them either as Chriſtians or as Officers, to give directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the acting of them, &amp; are to be acted by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who are no Officers; let it be proved that the rules about Ordination are to be put in practice by Officers onely. They might hold forth, that ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers might ordain, and yet be far from holding forth,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:120096:190"/>
that the people may not Ordain.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <q>From the nature of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a poteſtative and authoritative <note place="margin">Jus Divin. Min. p. 186.</note> Miſſion. It is an eminent act of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not onely confirming a Minister in that office which he had before by Election, but conveying the very office-power of preaching and administering the Sacraments. It is that which gives the eſſentials of the Miniſterial call; and therefore by the rule of the Goſpel it belongs to Officers, and not to private perſons. The Scripture doth accurately diſtinguiſh between Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulers, and private believers, <hi>Heb. 13. 17, 24. 1 Theſs. 5. 12.</hi> Private perſons can with no more lawfulneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey power to another, to adminiſter the Sacraments, then they can themſelves lawfully adminiſter the Sacraments. Church-power is firſt ſeated in Chriſt the head, and from him committed to the Apoſtles, and from them to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers. And they alone who have received it from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles can derive and tranſmit it to the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We deny that Ordination is a poteſtative and authoritative miſſion. We have ſhewn that there is a vaſt difference betwen miſſion and Ordination.</p>
               <p>2. We deny that Ordination is any act of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all; much leſs is it an eminent act of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: They would prove that the people may not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, becauſe ordination (ſay they) is an act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and that it is ſuch an act, they have not proved, and therefore the Argument falleth of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>What they have added, is far from proving it, as appeareth by what followeth.</p>
               <p>3. We deny that Ordination conveyeth the Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power of preaching and adminiſtring the Sacraments, or that it giveth the eſſentials of the Miniſterial call, the grounds of this denyal we gave before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:120096:191"/>
4. If Ordination did convey office-power, or gave the eſſentials of the Miniſterial call, yet that doth not prove into be an act of juriſdiction. It is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for the Free-men of a Corporation to convey office, power, or to give the eſſentials of a call to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to their Bayliffs and other Officers, and yet the Free-men are no Officers, nor cannot be ſaid to put forth an act of juriſdiction herein. And as it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture-proof, that if private perſons may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey power to others to adminiſter the Sacraments, then they may adminiſter the Sacraments themſelves, ſo it is againſt the very rules obſerved in civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where it is ordinary for ſuch to have a lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give the eſſentials unto the call to office, who have no power to execute the places of thoſe Officers which they make, but ought to be ruled by that power ſo communicated. In civil Corporations the Officers are as clearly diſtinguiſhed from the people governed, as in Church-affairs they can be, and yet the perſons governed convey the power to the Governors, and this without any act of juriſdiction, by voluntary ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo in Church-matters the people convey of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-power, not by an act of juriſdiction, but by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubjection or promiſing reverence, ſubmiſſion, and obedience in the Lord to ſuch perſons, in things wherein they act according to the Laws of their places, and the perſcriptions given unto Officers by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>All Church-power is firſt ſeated in Chriſt the head, and ſome was from him committed to the Apoſtles, and ſome power alſo is committed to other Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but that the derivation of it, is by Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by any act of juriſdiction, is not proved; and therefore the Argument is of no force againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples acting in Ordination. Our brethren tell us of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:120096:191"/>
ſome that renounce and diſclaim all Ordination from Miniſters, as unwarrantable and Antichriſtian, and take it up from the people as the onely way of the Goſpel. Who theſe are of whom they ſpeak, we know not.</p>
               <p>If ſome have renounced Ordination by Biſhops uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping power above ordinary Elders, and others have aſſerted that the people may ordain in caſe a Church hath no Officers in it, yet they do not hereby, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Ordination it ſelf, or all Ordination by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (one of which they muſt intend by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt, which they ſay is renounced) and hence they are far from running upon the evils which our brethren mention, or plunging themſelves into ſuch an inextricable difficulty as to renounce all the Miniſter; and Churches in the Chriſtian world, and turn Seekers; and therefore theſe objections concern not us.</p>
               <p>And now from all the premiſes we ſhall conclude (until we receive further light) that the Scriptures do witneſs the eſſence of a call to office to conſiſt in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that in ſome caſes the people may ordain their own Officers, and that ſuch as are furniſhed with preaching gifts and graces, may exerciſe them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly without Ordination.</p>
